"""

models.py contains the algorithms used to trained the supervised learning models.

The models include:
- Random Forests
- Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier)
- Logistic Regression

The models hyperparameters are left as default, apart from Logistic Regression whose max_iter
parameter has been set to 2000. This is because if it is less than this value it will fail to 
converge if grid_search_tuning is set to 'False'.

The models optimal parameters are then selected if desired by selecting grid_search_tuning as 
'True' in classification_experiments.py via Grid Search tuning.
