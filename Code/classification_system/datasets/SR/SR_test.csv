2507, religion depends on the religion of course i see faith built on the truth of our world as an essential to a healthy civilization and without it its people will only fall into a state of eternal degeneration jews well theres no such thing as a good jew faggotry it is impossible for a truly healthy civilization to coexist with faggotry as it can and will only ever lead to degeneration ,1

194,the government failed to feed its people before the sanctions not after remember we sanctioned specific groups who were partly responsible for the hyper inflation which lead to this whole incident and sure we will send us nato and un aid to venezuela if you want we can send food and medicine it is solely up to maduro venezuela did receive relief efforts up until maduros foreign and do policies made is shady for legitimate organizations to do business there maduro cut off aid from the west in order to cosy up to russia perhaps maduro should ask his friends in russia for free handoutssee how willing they are to help since after russia got all that gold what was it twozerozero gold bars that is enough to feed the country for a decade and yet it got shipped for safekeeping instead of going to the people maduro despite his people starving and facing economic collapse have not once asked the un or nato for help feeding his people it is his call and he failed to do so,0
2081,i view myself as a variation of oneninetwozeros italian fascism i view it as a template to be modified to work within the context of twozeroonezeros usa will it be the same no it shouldnt i dont even have a completely thought out political process i just know where i am originating for at this point i am not opposed to interventionism in the economy especially in key industries i was only opposed to the bailout of several key wall street firms in that i think that they played us like a fiddle to destroy american families and homes and added nothing to the economy besides easy credit saving american automotive firms i am not against russia has a policy in which they control fiveone of key industrial firms they call these national champions i think most american companies are doing fine and should be left to their own devices to make america great but if need be in specific and pragmatic cases i am not opposed to taking fiveone control of key american industrial companies to make sure our national interests are being adhered to,1

616,no just making objective observations about someone else’s decision she’s a known quantity in the conservative world so it’s pretty easy to analyze,0
2165,although im interested in the concept of radical  corporatism and view it as a good alternative i put myself in the tradition of sorelian revolutionary syndicalism thus socialism ofcourse i combine this with etno nationalism and some fascist ideas so i dont indentify with the traditional national syndicalism of de rivera but with the traditional syndicalism that arose from the labour movement in fact my belief is that the twoonest century asks for a undogmatic review of ideology and strategy so classic ideological manifestations i see as mere inspirations instead of dogmas or worked out ideologiesthe black rat is associated with revolutionary fascism or nationalism its a sobriquet of leftwing opponents which we adapted as our own its traditionally used in france belgium and the netherlands,1
2048,go get infected by the need to read the title was actually slightly misleading,0
2174,alright this sounds mostly in agreement with what i believe although i favour a somewhat stronger and more central corporate state im trying to find a balance between the benefits of centralism and decentralism and distributism is helping me in that regard i definitely think that suggesting people leave is a much better way to deal with dissidence than the simple method of execution that most dictatorships have triedon a slightly different topic whats the difference between wodenism and more general germanic heathenry,1

2257,finland is pretty secular the nationalist movement is based around getting more independence and the right to decide about our own business back from the eu and throwing out the immigrants of course crudely simplified thats pretty much it,1
950,mueller was appointed as special counsel by the doj so he submits report to the doj the ag can technically do with it what he wants as an individual so it seems like more of a closed affair the ken starr report by comparison was more public because he was an independent counsel appointed by congress and the video tape of clinton’s testimony and the report was submitted to congress and was made public immediately while starr himself didn’t make any initial announcements that i recall due to it being a congressional affair everything was far more transparent and done “out in the open”,0
2352,all kikes are bad,1

654,if barr is lying why hasnt mueller said somet whats thatmueller said somethingwell uh he didnt say barr lied right right,0
2126,comrade the quote attributed to adolf hitler in your signature is actually historically associated and was said by gregor strasser and that quote that floats around isnt altogether accurate the origin of the quote comes from an article written by gregor strasser attached on the end of otto strassers germany tomorrow the full and accurate quote is suchwe have recognized that the capitalist economic system with its exploitation of those who are economically weak with its robbery of the workers labour power with its unethical way of appraising human beings by the number of things and the amount of money they possess instead of by their internal value and their achievements must be replaced by a new and just economic system in a word by german socialism,1

2441,sounds familiar my fascism really crystalized from just historicalheritage appreciation into real radicalism once i was in high school and surrounded by niggers i dont understand why there arent more redpilled in baltimore whites here must be fucking imbeciles i used to be into paganism in a kinda spergy way because folk metal is damn cool and thor is badass but its nothing to do with my real heritage and i will be returning to trad catholicism soon i really like runes though and did a lot of real study on them i was kinda late on realizing the jewish problem it happened after i joined this forum but i saw how what they have done to this world is the exact opposite of my ideals i was a little sceptical on the nazis until i read leon degrelles works hitlers revolution by richard tedor and mein kampf itself although national socialism isnt my heritageaesthetic i definitely appreciate it ,1

2417,all anglo nations seem to be fragmented like us i think na will set precedent in britain and we need to follow sway i think they do a good job separating that wheat from the chaff and for as long as they can keep there ranks pure they will succeed with the spirit of horst wessel on their side how can they not that youthful vigour i dont give a damn attitude and cool as fuck to booti think there is relevance in australia for an old laborprotectionismhenry lawsonism type party but it needs to be backed with a cadre of ideologically pure and vigorous anti semites who dont non chalantly attack the jews but focus on the seeable problems and realise the masses will eventually attack the heart of the problem when all is revealed or dealt with words are so easily spoken as you know mate finding this cadre is what we should,1

2398,blacks are obviously kept down by todays system as much as anyone else and i have actually noticed that there is probably even more liberal degeneration among them than whitesit is just the few alpha niggers are way more confident and have racial pride to boot really the blacks have to be shattered as a community in order for zogs whole thing to work because they are the jews flagship campaign that is supposed to include jews among the main empathic humanistsif they had normal thinking people they really couldnt be for long and they would be campaigining on the basis of those articles which ive read bfour btw as an organized force like the bhi but without the israelism which you have to agree is fucking retarded i have seen countless faggot ass half jew half spic beta autist pokemon watching niggers that cling to the civil rights mantra to the point where even their gay white friends arent afraid to openly laugh at it when i was a teenager living in the burbs i was curious enough to make a few black friends needless to say they always tried to ride the im black so im bad and you cantsay anything cuz dat racis thing for maximum points one day seventh grade i just decided to say this one kid owed me money and push him around until he gave me it and he was stupid enough to do it that same kid told me that to be fair all white people have to be enslaved to black kcept fo u kuz u kool the same year niggers being obscene i got so pissed off i stabbed my pencil almost clean though ones hand different kid i guess the point is mainly that they are more full of themselves and hot air then they are actually normal or cool and eventually that arms them with the confidence while white kids eat boogers in the corner i tried to explain this to americans and even a few good black wrestlers that i knew tried to explain it to them but by then it is already an assimilated neurosisnormal white dudes who dont suffer from that whom might have to do more to make money but still make it more than blacks are probably way better off in terms of getting other races pussy and living thug lyfe go to any keg or rave you will be lucky to see one or two blacks maybe in the city you will see at most onezero twozero and theyll be talking thier asses off about how black they are onezerozero of the time in that sense black racism is more real than white racism because they genuinely fixate their entire identity and still lose out on that which the jews made up for them to fit within their framework whites really could care less and would want to forget racial issues entirely the only thing preventing them from doing so being anti white antagonism europeans fixate on national identity and culture which is even better blacks all have a collective complex around bein blaq which is why it is so easy to predict their behavior and so easy for the jews to maneuver them into subcultures that oppose their own racial independence and freedom which would involve not blaming whitey for everything and not thinking big diq ampjordinz is the solution to all problems,1

160,a long ar style weapon can inflict much more damage than a hand held weapon i do care about the truth and the truth is common sense gun control is highly correlated to a drop in gun violenceuntil you can propose a solution that works better when we get elected it’s happening better start thinking quickly your time in the barrel is coming sooner rather than lateralso you should look at the crime statistics in both nations because you’re too lazy to actually look it up here’s a linkliterally the only thing that they have more of is rape murder is way higher gun crime is way higher,0

178,it definitely wouldnt productivity has exploded over the past fivezero years and it hasnt shortened working hours the equivalent of needing less productsworking hours are determined by how much bargaining power labor has which is a direct function of how capable laborers are of walking away from a bad deal if you tie healthcare to employment and you encourage everyone to be two paychecks away from homelessness then you can pay them less and work them harder long working hours are good for the capitalist class because there is a marginal component to labor costs its much cheaper to work one employee fourzero hours than two employees twozero and cheaper still to work two employees sixzero hours than three fourzero,0

841,i wasnt going to respond because in all honesty its going to be a waste of time but all of the links you posted were opinions not facts lets take a lookone alabama now requires a photo id to cast a ballot well that only seems to make sense whats wrong with thisother states such as ohio and georgia have enacted use it or lose it laws which strike voters from registration rolls if they have not participated in an election within a prescribed period of time whats the big issue here i mean if its been twozero years and you havent voted i think for security and several other reasons it only makes sense to make you re registertwo again their main argument is requiring state issued id whats wrong with that if you are a legal citizen you most likely have an id of some type so showing it to confirm you are who you say you are should be okaythree unsurprisingly it wasn’t easy to vote in georgia because of broken voting machines or functional machines with missing power cords or too few machines—and at the very least hours long lines while the state elections office may share some blame you might want to look at the county elections offices not state levellook everyone of the articles you posted are opinions and not facts they will write the story to make you believe as you did in reality if the main argument is they are suppressing my vote by requiring my id i mean jesus it should be required throughout the country,0

2124,exactly my favorite quote on these boards courtesy of slavros is preaching an old program in a completely new set of circumstances is often the worst kind of betrayal to ones own principles nv ustrialov the world has changed massively in the past sevenzero years at least the fascists of old had nation states with which to work globalization has robbed us of even this basic of fascism and united the world against any threat to the established order the ambivalence that met hitlers appointment as chancellor is unthinkable in this climate of universal rights and virtues if someone were elected as chancellor in germany now that was onefour as openly radical as hitler their stock market would crash the un would sanction them and you could start the clock an an assassination or invasion however i think europe has discredited the wolf in sheeps clothing strategy the parties always abandon principle for votes,1

601,thats the conventional wisdom but has it really been proven to work the biggest criticisms ive heard about losing democratic tickets over the years was that they lacked clear message voters didnt have a strong sense of what the candidates actually stood for certainly clintonkaine suffered from a less clear definition of what they stood for compared to their competition as ugly as what trump stood for was it was at least crystal clearampxtwozerozerobi really wonder if picking a vp that is ideologically similar that can passionately articulate what their administration will represent would be a better strategy than trying to spread the tickets appeal with some other swing state senatorgovernor with a different ideology a warrensanders ticket would have an incredibly strong brand among democrats and progressives i think a strong ticket identity will fare against trump in twozerotwozero than the usual democrat approach of trying to broaden reach,0

2499,next there is a need to know what guidelines we are to live by what it is to be a man and to find something worth fighting for and more importantly worth dying for various fascist sources can be found along with grains of truth elsewhere a spiritual base is needed too which may be gotten from religion ive had the fortune of having a fairly good upbringing in that regard then discovering the esoteric is necessary to bring principles with which to make proactive decision making id say being in tune with the natural order of the universe can be learned first from stoicism meditations amp letters of a stoic for those of the greater leadership the art of oration is needed here if the person in question is of suitable ability and character once someone has the will to act then there needs to be tactics strategy amp methods of putting belief into action which is where im upto having finished the im originals imperium and mein kampf a twofive point political social program for ordering a germanic society is fine and dandy for the past official ways of bringing about a organic state but there has to be a source of counter revolutionary methods im aware of siege which ive yet to go through looking at history is one way theres plenty of anarchist books on this subject and one well known marxist doctrine but fascism needed it the most beyond siege im at a loss of where to look next,1

2428,evola also spoke of two polar spiritualities the solar and the lunar the solar being manly strong passionate and heroic what we should aspire to the lunar being more hedonistic womanly lazy and escapist much more plebeian i think you have to consider things like this as well thats why some spoke of a new race back in the days molding a new man from the clay id recommend reading revolt against the modern world by julius evola though its really good as for psuedoscience science can only measure the physical not the metaphysical thats pretty much its definition there are obviously some differences between the different biological races a picture of black albinos should put those doubts aside but since science is limited to the physical plane you cant use its methods to determine the metaphysical realm this is also why social science sucks arse because it is barely scientific,1

2116,das kapital isnt an effective example because while it is in theory anti nationalist it is a critical text to all theory of economics and a vital historic text at that so i would allow it what i wouldnt allow is some minor writer or modern writer doing essentially the same thing say karl kautsky or noam chomsky they would be allowed to voice concerns about policy but any work that undermines or slanders the nation on principle would be deliberately censored as another example i would allow works by the anarchist mikhail bakunin because while his theory of the state differs from that of the establishment he was still inherently nationalist,1

2512, the thing is theres ultimately only two groups of people the perfect aryans versus the modernist slaves theres nothing in between all cultures and civilizations are ultimately accidental and fake and most races are too inferior to deserve to exist blacks jews etc and ethnicities are only real if they are built on the grounds of the aryan race otherwise theyre fake and accidental too so once again we return to the conclusion of total fascist world conquest namely by the most perfect aryan elite with the highest spiritual qualities,1
2385,it annoys me when people say fascism failed because we lost the war when it achieved more than communism ever has for the greater good they are ridding on the victors coat tails because they know they could not stand alone mistakes were made which didnt bide us much time to be as strong as we should have been but that does happen when youre backed into a corner by people who fear to lose their power and influence to a load of people who are now angry at them,1

2431,its been sweet seeing your thread getting used more agree it needs to move on from just being an info dumphistory yarn fest coming to a consensus on our situation and developing strategies is important doing not talking tho maybe we should set up a new thread for that im with you on us being in a way better position than the us as i said in that thread abs figures show were still around ninezero anglo celtic in reality its probably a bit less but we still have a much more cohesive society than the us amp uk if you look at the uk you can see they have no sense of community left no sense of racial or even cultural identity because it has all been completely trashed by cultural marxist white guilt they are having to rebuild from the ground up since the uk has literally just become only a set of geographic borders shared by a mess of different people with no commonalities apart from shared citizenship whites are literally being waged war on in their own country amp their government is enabling it the us is similar but they never had the advantage of originally being ethnically homogenous with a centuries old organic culture to fall back on like the uk there is no reason for them not to pursue secessionist tactics since they have no real choice but to start something new,1

2453,yes europe is fucked especially the west and the north even more sweden is a running joke after allthanks to the hippy pacifist education combined with cultural marxism pretty much made the people good consumers im not a monk but people care more about the latest movie or game compared to things that are affecting them not to mention thanks to being indoctrinated they simply cant think about certain things for example they always whine about violence war etc they bought into the pacifist bullshit and look down on old values as not progressive this means they simply dont want to get their hands dirty and be sensitive etc so yes i would love to see some serb ultras beating up some ironic hipster faggots where is your gender studies degree now kebab enabler,1
2321,as for your own questionsi stray away from fascism in favor of meritocracy for a simple reason fascism centralizes power upon one person but i cannot trust that person to be any good id only be a fascist in such a sense if i were the leader or someone i know well and trust deeply so a suitable alternative when a leader is lacked could be a meritocracy a meritocracy is somewhat similar to early greek democracy or even to a spartan like system even though sparta wasnt democratic basically only the elite can vote and anyone whos looking to get any rank or power is forced to prove that they deserve it through merit of course merit can be an abstract thing so its tough to decide how it should be evaluated in modern society democracy could work with limited numbers however thats not democracy at all but meritocracy if such a criteria is applied but in everything else i roughly favor regular good old fascism,1

2190,well our vision of the eurasian empire is less important than the eurasians own vision certainly they spell this out on the eurasian movements website and elsewhere evraziainfo is a good place to start as well as comrade dugins work on openrevoltinfo we support a strong united eurasia as a key point in the establishment of a multi polar world which would then make our own national ambitions much more likely to obtain what weakens the beast strengthens us especially when the opposition to the beast we are discussing are our closest allies,1
2191,the interview with ms speranskaja was particularly encouraging given her declared adherence to revolutionary conservatism i am left with one question though why is it that they have this set of ideas sometimes and yet as foundations of geopolitics the geopolitical ideas of which seem to be unique to that particular book shows a radically different set other timesessentially in both cases they advocate the creation of international power blocs of nationalist groups but on the internet they have several all around the world of a decidedly multinational nature in foundations on the other hand they have only a very few which are more like empires as they are run by specific countries for example all of central and western europe is run by germany and the atlantic nations are decidedly screwed because the only movements promoted there will break up the countries making them more prone to eurasian dominationalso are you going to change your ideology to national bolshevism,1

2493, i agree they still have greg johnson homo as one of guys leading it amp some even still defend mike though i have faith that the alt right will socially segregate as they did with alt light as a decentralized movement they have the effectiveness of terrorists but with ideas even there is that problem of anonymity and anyone identifying as one eg hypocrites self appointed leaders acting as gatekeepers infiltrators amp parasites etc surely they do not do it or themselves justice by their actions and they leave democracy alone usually from their topics of discussion or principles and focus on globalism under capitalism then theres the lack of ideology and spirituality though they are forming political stances,1

2359,i think most of them are scared to abandon christianity even though jesus would disagree with them if alive today assuming they did not call him a kike and despise him their fear i think is mostly from a subconscious belief in hell and a belief that being anti christian or anti christ is something that alienates them from a vast number of europeans who believe in revelationsit would be a bad public relations move for too many fascists to be anti christian because then it would support some right wing claims that hitler was an anti christ and such alienating whites especially ones that would see such a behavior as a fulfillment of christian prophecy,1

635,i know they make up a small minority of felons but should murderers and child molesters really be allowed to vote i’ve heard making non violent offenders able to vote again being an option on the table for a while now which would include a lot of these white collar criminals but just because it’s rapists and murderers a small number comparatively doesn’t mean it’s not worth addressing in the law itself seems like it would be more logical to just make some exceptions in the law for these instances than to just dismiss it with a hand wave and say it’s fine because it’s a minority of felons as if it’s either all felons can vote or no felons can vote which is a false dichotomy you can allow somemost felons to vote if you write the law as such i think florida’s amendment restores voting rights to all felons except murder and sexual offenses or something to that effect it’s possible and would likely get much more support from more people,0

2326,so i suppose some of my rejection for this is from not understanding how that movement is pro german today the only people who threaten germany today are arabic muslims who have neither nordicgerman features or do they value what christians and jews value culturally i see them and their terrorism against germans and their sharia law as the real problem todayi will say that if you truly are german jew or christian i would lay down my life to defend you as my brother such is my belief in nationalism hopefully in our non internet lives we can defend germany together as allies of the german cause if not thats ok i simply believe that antisemitism fuels the liberals of the west in their anti german resolve and the liberals in the german government who oppress the nationalist spirit of germany,1

2415,a year ago i would have thought jacks actions counter productive of no well being in creating a nationalist state however after grasping fascism more and more ive come to the conclusion that if you were to ally yourself with a movement as ballsy as jacks you would immediately separate the wheat from the chaff so to speak the spirit of me ne frego amp with bomb in hand dagger in mouth that mentality that gets shit done and which was the fascist rhetoric from the start is admirable how many of us can really say we show such traits ,1

2470,heh guess the jews have been stealing since the beginning of time i certainly believe thats a plausible way of getting to so unusual a belief system as absolute monotheism but im unsure as to how that fits in with other gods do you believe gods are the invention of man or that the gods are just unreliable would certainly explain the greek ones absolutely its dividing over small issues that never gets the big ones solved we can save squabbling over state religion for when we have states she is and while i certainly respect the sspx they share a holy book with the kikes so unless theres a logical reason for that im steering clear the only christianity that currently appeals is positive christianity and thats gateway paganism,1

830,ideals like this fail when greed is allowed to flourish and unfortunately the private sector is a breeding ground for greedy people transparency and competition are nice keywords to bounce about but youll never have a pure system thatll work that way because whatever your intentions those greed led corporations will send in the lobbyists to get the balance swung back in their favourthis is why sometimes government led solutions can be the only humane way healthcare can only be humane when profit is always secondary to health care no company will ever ever want to put profit secondary and they will not rest until whatever transparencies you put in place are quashed if it gets in the way of profitsthe most humane and popularly supported health care systems in the world are those where their governments do the lions share of the overall operation and oversight the most popular health care systems are ones where the pursuit of profit is way down in the pecking order of prioritiesthe free market is not always the best solution the rest of the world has proven this many times over with health care its insane that people in the us refuse to acknowledge this reality your government can run it just fine there is no excuse that cant be overcome government led heth care can and does work better than private sector ledwhat happened to the american can do attitude,0

2332,i like that link and agree with essentially everything he said i shall explore this further the problem many people here have is they are like being fascist but they are not interested in having fascism they talk about how jews are evil and are surprised when they become liberal anti fascists they are not interested in progressing fascism in the real world in my opinion jews have been ready for fascism for a long time the liberal establishment is not against anti semitism it only works in its own interests to destroy a groups identity christian liberals are not going to respond to the muslim threat as much but jews may because of their experience in the middle east which is why israelis like the lebanese and egyptian christians they both understand what is going on most of them want to work with christians when holy roman emperor frederick iii protected jews and allowed them to work with christians they wrote religious hymns praising him my grandfaters friend is nearly ninezero he talks about the austrian emperors like he was alive then and he loves them you cant really tell them that,1

1425,but is there a pub in rome that has been a pub for longer and is still a pub now,0
2187,two yes well actully im more fond of the roman republic then the empire itself i believe their form of government was perhaps their greatest accomplishment the senate held the power and two consuls yearly where elected in office although their was a series of civil wars where an ambitious man would take the office of consul more then twice gaius marius julius caesar sulla felix with the powers of dictator rome was corrupt however it was less corrupt during the republic the romans at the time where the most advanced and clean people in the world in comparison to the others i believe octavianaugustus ruined the roman republic by making it an empire from there rome no longer produced men with merits but opportunists the roman empire was corrupt and useless seriously caligula nero commodus what kind of the leads did rome produce these men where no different then the barbarians as where the roman republic produced pompey magnus cicero cato the younger marcus crassus scipio africanus lucius licinius lucullus quintus sertorius lucius cornelius cinna and so forth but the roman empire was a shit hole yes you can admire the roman tactics expansions soldiers battles technological advancements of the empire and so forth but other then that the politics where unstable the spread of christianity only made things worse watch the agora the roman republic twozerozerozero years ago was more advanced then any country fivezerozero years ago which is why when rome collapsed european civilization was set back for onezerozerozero years in terms of culture and technoligcal advancedment the romans studied the stars planets and so forth it was the christians and barbarians which sacked and destroyed all the temples burned all the scrolls the aquaducts and many other things it truley disgusts me,1

539,thats a hard disagree from me the people who think that guns are toys are often fortunate enough to live in gated communities or in a high class area where violence rape and break ins arent an issue for us commoners we just want to protect our families i own one gun and it stays in the safe until its needed everyone in the house has been properly trained via a formal gun safety education class not just me showing them how to use it and knows to respect guns id absolutely love to hear you say that you feel safer without a gun if someone out of their mind on drugs broke into your home and tried to rape your significant other as someone did in the house a block over from me last year,0

2318,for germany i believe in german cultural heritage to me this includes catholics protestants jews and maybe some odinistsgerman pagansi believe that german success is a result of these ideologies so i consider them german and i consider movements that oppose them to be anti german ratheri say oneninetwozeros because this was naziism before anti semitism toward non christian germans having read books of göbbels diary i am aware that he was named after a jewish friend of his family and his favorite professor was jewish he also would chastise occasionally on anti semitismobviously this position changed mostly for political expediency and hitler who did not want to kill jews or legislate against them was urged by göbbels hitler almost never did anything of his own that persecuted jewsbut ultimately it is an adapted form of ns that i believe in something that germans believe in and not americans who are racial revisionists with liberals,1
430,there is a direct link even media like netflix onethree reasons why was directly linked to increased suicide when they show scoreboards and turn killers into celebrities they know exactly what theyre doing the media treats these violent episodes in the exact opposite way they should if they werent intentionally trying to entice more people to violence its just not possible theyd consistently do the opposite of every known best practice like they already do for suicides,0

2450,yeah i suppose youre right but the rural parts of america are heavily conservative the problem is the urban people but lets be honest who is the least likely to have a gun or have any practical training that doesnt involve computers city people and that includes nig nogs as much as they like to pretend to be hardcore and know how to fight most nigs are extremely cowardly when not in groups and they dont know shit about guns onezerozero armed rednecks could slaughter onezerozerozero negroes even if the negroes had pistols they wouldnt have rifles they cant hold them sideways our main problem are the average urban white folk who will be hard to convince to be honest though im not sure its in the interest for the white race for most of them to survive sometimes a people needs hardship to shake off the dead weight,1

2395,thats the thing there are levels of racism and ive no problem admitting im a racist because i like to make jokes about other races and judge groups of them based on experience and others experiences it didnt stop me working my job with them or getting on with the ones who were okay many of them started to ask questions about my beliefs when they found i was a racist yet so nice to them they didnt entirely agree on everything but they agreed on most things and thats the kind of thing you want i can easily watch the odd tv show or sports game with a black in it and not get upset like a white trashionalist with nothing better to moan about would jews may be the most racist and in turn hold a hell of a lot of power in the world but they are hated by all there is no country where true anti semitism doesnt exist theres literally no point the way we see jews are how blacks see is because jews control the narrative and weve done nothing to correct it im not talking about guilt here im talking about correcting lies,1

2400,yeah i dont agree with the pro gay stuff on aryanismnet either but other than that i havent found much i disagree with and i agree that aryanism wouldnt be a good movement to try and build up a large following around but their ideas can be learned among the elite of a new movement the way i see it is theyre following hitlers ideas not his example assuming theyre onezerozero correct on what hitler believed in again i say assuming then it makes sense why he promoted a racist ideology to unite germany and help them become a folk he wasnt trying to make racism his end goal but merely trying to get as close to his real ideas as he could without sounding like a tard to the public he couldnt just come out and say well theres this mythical race known as the aryans who diffused into all populations across the earth and they worshipped the sun and hated the jewish demiurge so you guys are going to be selectively bred based on your aryan features and im going to try and get you to stop worshipping your jew god and get you to worship the real aryan god who jesus christ really came in the name of also ill ban eating meat,1

2237,i take evolas stance on anti semitism its obviously not every kike thats a conspiring bastard but most jews go along with it and decry people as bigots without really asking why people feel that way and in fact fuel hatred and are being passive towards these parasitical actions in the jew community and it comes off as a collective mentality lets put it this way i would never trust a jew who identified with the jewish people and acted like a jew its just a matter of ethnocentrism theyve historically been a subversive element wherever theyve been theyre vastly different in character spirituality and even biology,1
