2,Iron_March,"This journal (about 25 pages) provides a good amount of information on the corporatist idea in the first pages.  I am reading it because of my interest in China, but I haven't gotten far enough to tell you what it says about it's China.  I know that fascists have some interest in Corporatism so I thought they might find it interesting.",Fascist,Yes,Totalitarianism / Authoritarianism,Iron_March,337,en,275
3,Iron_March,"AS for the book you sent a link to: it is interesting but doesn't have anything to do with corporatism, just in the sense of corporate bodies being involved in government. For the time being you may post it in the Fascist Economics subforum.",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,241,en,198
4,Iron_March,"I don't know if you've seen many of my posts on this forum yet, but I do believe in the inferiority of the negroid race and the overall superiority of the caucasoid race, and in particular the ethnic British people out of all white ethnic groups.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,246,en,201
5,Iron_March,"In defining superiority I rank it like this:

As for economics, I'm more of a state capitalist than corporatist. It seems we have similar views already.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,636,en,580
6,Iron_March,"I actually agree with you about intelligence being separate from creativity. I can't recall it entirely but there is a certain gene that is believed to be linked to creativity that is very low in mongoloids and near enough absent in negroids, but it is common to find it in caucasoids, particularly Northern Europeans (nordics). I see IQ as a good life predictor and measurement of G, but I have a interest in PISA, SATS and TIMSS as they correlate at a great level with 'g' as well and can be accurately converted into IQ scores as Richard Lynn and many others have shown consistently. It's been known since 1903 (or earlier) that the SATS correlates highly with intelligence. Emotional-Intelligence quotient is a good measurement too. IQ is one of the best we've got, however.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,778,en,644
7,Iron_March,"I'd probably have to re-read over The Global Bell Curve to see if Lynn comments about the verbal ability of Mongoloids raised in the west. It sounds plausible though. I choose TGBC since that does it for various different countries and has a huge collection of different studies. It really is a fantastic book, it brings back memories of when I first started reading stuff by Arthur Jensen; I can upload it if you're interested, but it will be in jpg form/scanned.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,464,en,383
8,Iron_March,"By energy I mean sporting activity. I didn't put blacks at the top because it's a common misconception; they aren't nearly as strong as caucasoids, good at football (soccer) as caucasoids are; nor are they better boxers, although I do have some admiration for Tyson and Muhammed Ali (especially Ali's race separation views) and I do concede that they were good. By no means representative of the whole sport or their race's ability in that sport.

This issue is going to be different since I'm trying to get more writers on board.

16,Iron_March,"The group was started when I collaberated with a philanthropist who indicated he wanted to seriously start a fascist political party in the united kingdom. at the time I was in college (2009) and the outfit was essentially like previous internet start up parties and didn't get anywhere - I began to question why there was little progress so since then I have been on a developing mission to find out how to make a contemporary movement succeed. I started attack as an experiment and it provoked interest among young people. Many of them were local to me so I organised meetings with them, and got to know them all. we eventually got shot of our former leader and started everything from scratch just a few months ago. The purpose of the party is now primarily for activism of a new kind.

It just seems a society is more in harmony with a single established culture, for awhile I played with the idea that blacks can be assimilated but they have such a backwards culture. I'm still on the fence though.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,434,en,364
19,Iron_March,"While I can see where you're coming from, I have to disagree. The black community suffers mainly from a 'ghetto' effect. Namely the effect of innate economic disadvantages coupled with still-existing discrimination working against upward mobility. We also need to disperse the ghetto population to destroy the subculture and encourage greater assimilation whilst keeping the Southern and American traditions and heritage alive.

What are your thoughts on NSM88? Are there any NS groups or Fascist parties in the US worth working with?",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,262,en,215
24,Iron_March,"Yep, at the moment there's a huge argument over what it really is. I believe in Peron's original Peronism, which was mostly based on Mussolini's policies and is Third-positionist. Unlike Mussolini though, he didn't really believed in using violence as much as Mussolini and had different opinions on Labour Unions (He believed they should be Nationalised, rather than abolished). He virtually had the same ideas as Mussolini on everything (Highly nationalist, Somewhat isolationist, Corporatism etc.).
Most people claiming to be the successors of Peron really aren't, and are just stating that to gain popular support (Peron is still loved in Argentina).",Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,654,en,555
25,Iron_March,"Just a note of sympathies. After reading your debate (the term here being more properly 'lalalaicanthereyoucommie fest') with FacistCapitalist, I couldn't help myself. Also the Southern dialect is probably an affectation. During my time as a Southern Nationalist inserting dialect was often a way just to irritate people. While dialect does come through in speech it rarely transfers to paper. Of course I'm not an educated self-made businessman, so what do I know?",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,465,en,393
26,Iron_March,"I agree that things need to change dramatically but I am not sure whether a total, systematic breakdown is necessary. I look at America in a similar manner as Rome, I think we could very easily be molded into this kind of grand, imperial nation while maintaining characteristics of the old guard. Rome started out as a Republican government and then slowly turned into the Empire we all know. Certain institutions remained, some left, some were absorbed into others. But most people often hearken back to Rome when they think of the archetypal fascist government.",Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,563,en,469
27,Iron_March,"Well it all depends. I am not as revolutionary as a lot of the people on here. American Blackshirt and I were talking and he said he thought the whole system had to be destroyed. I wouldn't go that far. I kind of view America as analogous to Rome. And right now, I feel like we are ripe for the transition from a Republic to an Empire, much in the same way Rome was. I think that, as Americans, we really need to be looking at our problems from a more national, as opposed to international, perspective. I know that diving into things like Evola, using Runes and paramilitary uniforms is all the rage with members but that will never fly in America, at least not with the majority of people. The two most successful fascist/authoritarian leaders in America were Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin, both of whom appealed to Americans on a much more basic, effective level. 
When it comes to actual action I am at a loss. I think trying to raise a third party from the ground up will not have any success unless there is an extremely popular candidate who defects to the party. For instance, the Bull Moose party had Roosevelt. We, at present, do not have that. I think that a combination of a Politcal Action Committee to try to elect strong centralist candidates coupled with a public think tank to spur discussion and get the wheels of the people rolling would be excellent ideas. Easier said than done obviously but all plans have to start somewhere. ",Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,1456,en,1192
28,Iron_March,"I've been toying with the idea of starting up a Fascist movement in Australia.
Perhaps something to combat the Campus Commies in my University?
What are you're thoughts on the idea?
I'm thinking of making a new thread about it.",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,227,en,191
29,Iron_March,"The problem is that overtly Fascist groups, even the lighter forms of it, do not do well. The Communists are tolerated mostly in part to their perceived pacificity (if there was a war between the Soviets and Europe this would not be the case). An additional issue is that many of the socially conservative policies (extolled by several members of this forum for example) similarly do not do well and attract hostility. What I would suggest is joining one of the existing liberal (small L liberal, like the Liberal Party) groups and canvassing to what extent if any there is fascist, or at least conservative militarist leanings. You may also find sympathisers from the other end of the spectrum (as is the nature of third positionist thinking), although there you run the risk of running into Antifa or worse, leftist, free-spirit hippies. 
Starting a thread about it would be good, but again the problem I see is that fascism is inherently going to draw hostility, and any suggestion of deviation from 60 yr old outdated manifestos on this forum seems to draw cries of a liberal conspiracy. Actual political pragmatism or even intelligence seems almost non-existent. (although perhaps the departure of WTP will help this).",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1223,en,1019
30,Iron_March,"I tell ya, sometimes I'm truly shocked by how Marxist some of the arguments some posters on here make.

31,Iron_March,"I view myself as a variation of 1920's Italian Fascism.  I view it as a template, to be modified to work within the context of 2010's USA.  Will it be the same? No.  It shouldn't.  I don't even have a completely thought out political process, I just know where I am originating for at this point. 
I am not opposed to interventionism in the economy, especially in key industries.  I was only opposed to the bailout of several key Wall Street firms in that I think that they played us like a fiddle, to destroy American families and homes and added nothing to the economy besides easy credit.  Saving American automotive firms, I am not against.  Russia has a policy, in which they control 51% of key industrial firms. They call these ""National Champions"".  I think most American companies are doing fine and should be left to their own devices to make America great, but if need be, in specific and pragmatic cases, I am not opposed to taking 51% control of key American industrial companies to make sure our national interests are being adhered to.",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1056,en,856
32,Iron_March,"    My value system should reflect the military, and it should be pushed onto the populace, but I'm loathe to use a whip and chain to enforce it.

33,Iron_March,"For some people here, the internet is the only place where they have a political life. And I hate to say it, but for most of them Fascism will just be a fad, and everything will be forgotten when they reach 40. Maybe not people such as Slavros or Ben...but most of them. TThey don't have real-life Fascist comrades, never went to a demonstration, never spent the night outside glueing propaganda stuff on the wall.
So yeah, some of them think this is some kind of Call of Duty or WoW game, heyyy let's play tough guys and dress up like Nazi Stormtroopers.
Personally I take this with a grain of salt. I once was a very young 18 years-old interested in politics but being completely out of touch with reality. So I'm not gonna cast the first stone to people behaving like I once did. And it is still enjoyable  to exchange views with people from over the world - and for me, to keep in touch with younger generations' mindset. I'm 42, their ways are not my ways, and I do think I also have things to learn from them, even if sometimes they sound overly idealistic.

How much of a stigma (if any) is attached to anti-Russian sentiments in Finland due to Finland's vulnerability to Russia?

Strasser's most in depth vision of what a National Socialist system would look like was in ""Germany Tomorrow"". 
Here he propounds the need for the redistribution of property and the ""de-proletarianization"" of all Germans. Strasser goes into detail and says that the class of property owners are transformed into managers accountable to both the state and the workers themselves. The manager owns the majority of the stock in the company; so he makes more by managing and performing the work that capitalist actually do; however the workers too own a share of their company and engage in profit sharing so that the system of wages is anulled. Strasser also claims this system will give working Germans a say in management of said enterprise. Public trading of stocks is forbidden and market competition is over ridden by degrees of economic planning from the state (such as investments and being a last resort employer for members of the folk who work in no enterprise; thus ensuring full employment). 
Strasser's main objection to capitalism was that the class of industrialists (capitalists) were able to exercise so much influence while leaving the little guys out of it. It was un-folkish to him. Likewise this was also his reason for rejecting Marxism, ""a socialism alien to the Germany"". He saw the Marxist theory of ""dictatorship of the Proletariat"" as replacing one class dictatorship with another, which it essentially is. He envisioned a future of Germans working cooperatively and working together as one single entity rather than worrying just about class interest.

54,Iron_March,"What do you like about Julius Evola? There are only a few things I like about Evola, but I kind of hate his overall philosophy. In essence, he argues that we should all live in stratified, patriarchal caste societies which he justifies using some occult bullshit ideas. He also denounces a lot of spiritual beliefs I have as being “lunar.” Most of what he calls lunar spirituality is good stuff (although that’s not to say that what he calls solar is bad).
To elaborate, Evola’s teachings obviously have some positive aspects from a conservative racialist-nationalist perspective, especially in his criticisms of the enemies. You’re already aware that his teachings on race had some influence on my thinking (although I might say that he is simultaneously somewhat misleading when it comes to race as well). However, I find his doctrine as a whole unacceptable, especially his idea of Tradition. What he calls “Tradition” is actually a mixture of practices and beliefs which are not always actually part of what I consider to be proper traditional Aryan practices, even though a few of them are. Evola takes things too far; the ancient European way of life did include a hierarchical society ruled by a monarch, but this elite was Folkish (i.e. to love the people as a whole) and socialistic, even though it practiced a simplistic tribal form of socialism. It was not some rigid caste system with an aristocracy obsessing over strange spiritual ideas which no one really believed (An example of what I’m thinking of is Evola’s idea that we need to be “initiated” to become immortal and the whole “solar”/“lunar” distinction, which is something I believe he is really wrong about).",Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,1680,en,1400

It may suprise you but most leftist intellectuals (who campaigned for abortion and workplace equality) were against women having the vote or being involved in politics at all because of their social conservatism. This was the reason alcahol was banned in the US - because it was destroying homes. Sylvia pankhurst types were lunatic fringe communists - most became involved in fascism instead.
With that in mind it is intuitive that Mosley didn't think they were Stupid or generally less able but the priority of the economy and the society was around the family unit. this is what mosley meant when he said that women were not going to be chased out of the workplace, but were not going to be chased in there either.

Bowie was quoted in Stockholm as saying that ""Britain could benefit from a Fascist leader"", and detained by customs on the Russian/Polish border for possessing Nazi paraphernalia. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the ""Victoria Station incident"". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, the singer waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in <em>NME</em>. Bowie said the photographer simply caught him in mid-wave.<sup></sup>He later blamed his pro-Fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. ""I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur ..."".

Would I be correct in saying that we are two ethnonationalists stuck in a country hellbent on destroying ethnicity?
If so, do you have any ideas on what we could do to further our goals?
</div></blockquote>
You would be correct.
As for furthering our goals, I believe it calls for a departure from what is traditionally known as ""White Nationalism"" as it seems that movement is nothing more than a bunch of nostalgic paleo-conservatives with an anti-semetic flavor. I believe this sort of ethno-nationalism wouldn't just benefit whites, but would benefit every ethnic group on the American continent. White nationalism is entirely too reactionary for my tastes.
I think we should be promoting ethnic-pride though, definitely. Europeans need a sense of identity, and it wouldn't hurt to spread the word. As many Nationalistic states in the past have shown, it is possible to love your own without being chauvinistic towards others.
Also lets remember that one of the key characteristics of the liberal system is that it is sin to show ethnic-pride if you are white. I believe it is worthwhile to point out.",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,1181,en,989
119,Iron_March,"Anyway, I have some more to say about ethnic-nationalism (which might be a good term to replace ""white nationalism"" by the way). I use to be a white nationalist when I was much younger (I am sure a lot of people here started out as WNs) but have since moved on to more practical ideas. The current ""white nationalist"" movement here in the United States is very hostile to social-nationalism and conservative revolution to them means nothing more than guys in revolutionary war outfits getting rid of a supposed ""red conspiracy"" in the white house. I've actually only met a couple guys from Keystone United (KU) that were open to my social ideas but they can't seem to get past the whole ""14-88 race war"" mumbo jumbo. 
It is a tricky moment in time. We do not want to sew discord among those classes which actually have a chance at revolting against this system, but at the same time we want to have some identity beyond just class as well. This is why Marxists have it wrong, and always will. Humans are more than their social class and job. They have ethnic, national, and religious identities as well which Marxist theory discards as unimportant and just a product of the economy. Back to the point though. A race war is the last thing we need. Not only are whites outnumbered in the world, but they are especially in this continent. Not to mention any whites fighting both a race war and a war against their ""race traitor government"" would be wiped out completely. We simply do not have the manpower and resources. I also think a race war is entirely unnecessary and obviously runs counter to the idea that all ethnic-groups should have a right to self determination (like whites).",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,1685,en,1385
120,Iron_March,"In my opinion, we need to be harnessing the revolutionary potential of the oppressed proletariat in our nations. Whether they be white, black, yellow etc., rather than simply agitating hatred against other races. I believe that if we have a vanguard party of sorts, we can take revolutionary movements back from the Marxists and Internationalists and ensure that the coming revolution and fall of the capitalist system results in a degree of ethnic-self determination and the reaffirmation of identity based on something other than class and the economy. Marxists to this extent are really not even revolutionary, as they are the unwanted offspring of the materialist capitalist thought. A true revolution happens not only on the economic plain but happens on a spiritual one as well, an ideal one, and society is transformed by not just matter (materialist thought) and not just ideals (idealism) but a combination of those which forms the spirit of the revolution. ",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,967,en,811
121,Iron_March,"When I speak of Dutch National Socialism I mostly refer to so called ""Mussertism""; the ideas of Anton Mussert, the leader of the Dutch NSB. The NSB is an interesting topic to study, when it was founded the only thing that was national socialist about it was the party structure and the name. It barely mentioned race or Jews and Dutch East-Indians and Dutch Jews were proud members of it. In fact, over seas in Dutch East India the NSB was the third largest party. Economically they were corporatist.
Anton Mussert and his branch of National Socialism favoured Dutch independence and Dutch culture, while parties like the NSNAP (Nationaal Socialistische Nederlandse Arbeiders Partij= National Socialist Dutch Workers Party) used slogans like ""Nederduits weder Duits!"";""Nethergermany must be German again!"". They wanted to annex us in the Third Reich. Such ideas, as you can imagine, weren't really popular.
By the mid/late 1930's Rost Van Tonningen joined the NSB and he quickly got more and more influence within the NSB. Rost Van Tonningen was, in contrast to Mussert, a more pro-German national socialist. He was more radical if it came to subjects like race and Jews, these ideas, however, were not so popular so the popularity of the NSB slowly decreased. I mostly use him as the prime example of ""Germanic/German National Socialism"".
Then everything changed because the Germans invaded us and made the NSB the only legal party. Membership reached an all time peak in 1943. Mussert had to make loads of concessions to the Germans, in order to stay in favour. The party started to do simply what the Germans wanted. Every time Mussert protested something the Germans threatened to replace him with Rost. Meanwhile Musserts own ideas didn't remain unchanged either. He started to believe Adolf Hitler was send by god to create a Greater Germanic empire. Mussert envisioned this Empire to consist of independent states working closely together. He presented the idea to Hitler who simply ignored it. He had at the moment better things to do, and simply didn't care.
Meanwhile Mussert tried to convince the Germans that the Dutch SS  recruits (we had our own SS) should swear an oath to the Netherlands and Mussert, and he in turn would pledge allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Mussert took the oath, but the Dutch SS ended up still pledging loyalty to Hitler. This is the prime reason he was convicted for treason after the war, and he was executed.",Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,2445,en,2039

123,Iron_March,"Yes, I realized the need to stop identifying as a ""Strasserite"" due to the fact that I am an American and not only are such ideas virtually unknown to 90% of European-Americans but I don't think National Socialism the way Strasser explained it would work exactly the way it was supposed to here (even though a great deal of my inspiration still comes from Otto Strasser). 
So, I naturally redefined myself as a National-Anarcho-Syndicalist. I would imagine this would combine the best aspects of Strasserite National Socialism as well as Else Christensen's National-Anarcho-Syndicalism. If you are not familiar with Else Christensen she was one of the most important people in the revival of the folkish religion Odinism (which I practice). She was also heavily involved in the Syndicalist labor movement and advocated a very decentralized form of National Syndicalism, in which syndicates, unions, cooperatives, etc etc (all just different names for the same things) manage businesses on a local level. I'd imagine it working like Strasser's factory fellowship only, and I have hinted at this before, the numbers would be a little different. 
As for Government, I believe it would also look like a return to an estates system and natural democracy, rather than parliamentarism, as advocated by many conservative revolutionaries as well as Otto Strasser. Instead of federalized, it would be a confederation and much less centralized in order to meet the racial, cultural, and geographic diversity here in the USA. People would be encouraged to organize themselves in their own communities based on ethnic interests or otherwise. All communities within the confederacy would be respectful of each other's self determination and cooperate. I think a constitution would be necessary in this respect. It is anarchist in the sense that, it isn't centralized and people aren't forced to make decisions they would otherwise not want to. If one does not wish to abide by the rules of a certain folk community, they are free to leave, but they must respect the laws of the community while residing there. 
Again, it would all be democratic but at the same time still maintain the natural organic hierarchy that is essential to the human condition and it would also be totally against any sort of political parties and parleamentarism which seek only to divide and sunder the community into factions.",Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,2390,en,2003

136,Iron_March,"1) I've always been disgusted by Religion. Mainly the Judeo-Abrahamic-Christian religion in particular. Religion breeds ignorance and prevents one from thinking rationaly. The founding fathers of my nation where Deists, Secularists and Agnostics. They did their best to keep this festering disease of religion out of American government and politics. And for a good Reason. As.. for Atheism rejects the existance of god as a fiction devied by man desperate to keep on living despite the inevitability of death. For centuries, Atheists thought presented in fair light were prevented from making their mark on the world due to the Feudal ignorance of organized religious intitutions that existed. The age we live in may seem ""Nihilistic"" but only in the eyes of christians and believers, in fact, it's existentialist.The true believers of yesterday and the day before have every interest in characterizing the worst and most negative aspects of contemporary life as products of Atheism. For many, religion is their way of life, shaping their morality and ideas through the belief in god rather then lgoic, for many the imposibility of thinking or acting outside their religious sect, which has laws regulating every tiniest detial of daily life, all these things militate against reason and in the favor of submission. It's almost as if religion needs to innocence, lack of education, and ignorance in order to thrive. Religion truley is an opium of the masses. And, perhaps, in this way you can get the slow but ultimate disappearance of the Churches as institutions of power and mind's conditioning. The individual, as a citizen must be devoted and dedicated only to the requirements of the Stateand its national community, and not to faint and hypothetical ideas of supernatural, also for this reason to wear any elements that are outward signs of religious affiliation should be allowed only to clerics not to ordinary citizens. But this will only happen with a gradual persuasion, not by an act of force, otherwise it risks reinforcing the grip of religion on society, creating more myths and martyrs. yet... religions can't be, unfortunately, easily eradicated, at least in the short term. What I think is important is that Churches and their institutions and their teachings, are always subordinate and subject to the authority of the State, are deprived of all privileges and destroyed, churches which take away money that could be invested for the needs of people, their teachings and their morals are against the principles of the State, and do not carry out activities for the State.

137,Iron_March,"2) Yes. Well actully I'm more fond of the Roman Republic then the Empire itself. I believe their form of Government was perhaps their greatest accomplishment. The Senate held the power, and two consuls yearly where elected in office. Although their was a series of civil wars, where an ambitious man would take the office of consul more then twice (Gaius Marius, Julius Caesar, Sulla Felix) with the powers of Dictator. Rome was corrupt however it was less corrupt during the Republic. The Romans at the time where the most advanced and clean people in the world in comparison to the ""others"". I believe Octavian(Augustus) ruined the Roman Republic by making it an Empire. From there, Rome no longer produced men with Merits but opportunists. The Roman Empire was corrupt and useless.

Which is why when Rome collapsed European civilization was set back for 1000 years in terms of culture and technoligcal advancedment. The Romans studied the Stars, planets, and so forth.

I say 1920s because this was Naziism before ""anti semitism"" toward non Christian Germans. Having read books of Göbbels diary, I am aware that he was named after a Jewish friend of his family, and his favorite professor was Jewish. He also would chastise occasionally on anti semitism.
Obviously, this position changed mostly for political expediency. And Hitler, who did not want to kill Jews or legislate against them, was urged by Göbbels. Hitler almost never did anything of his own that persecuted Jews.

Most people will think of the racialist ethnically confused Americans likely because many on the Internet are American. And Americans, no matter whether they are far left or far right, are essentially brainwashed by the same institutions of thinking.
I do see it being a problem sometimes. It is so alien to some people (interestingly, all of these people have been Americans), that they think I must be joking or disingenuous.
I am not sure what I would call myself though. But I was inspired by the early works of Strasser, in some ways.
It is good you asked though, as I was considering posting in the thread about National Socialism, but I would probably be criticized by the Americans, who think National Socialism is entirely about ""gassing kikes.""

271,Iron_March,"As for your own questions...
I stray away from Fascism in favor of Meritocracy for a simple reason. Fascism centralizes power upon one person, but I cannot trust that person to be any good. I'd only be a fascist in such a sense if *I* were the leader, or someone I know well and trust deeply. So a suitable alternative when a Leader is lacked could be a meritocracy. A meritocracy is somewhat similar to early greek democracy, or even to a spartan-like system even though sparta wasn't democratic. Basically, only the elite can vote, and anyone who's looking to get any rank or power is forced to prove that they deserve it through merit. Of course, ""merit"" can be an abstract thing, so it's tough to decide how it should be evaluated in modern society. ""Democracy"" could work with limited numbers, however, that's not democracy at all, but meritocracy if such a criteria is applied.

 The problem many people here have is they are like being Fascist, but they are not interested in having Fascism. They talk about how Jews are evil, and are surprised when they become liberal anti Fascists. 
They are not interested in progressing Fascism in the real world. 
In my opinion, Jews have been ready for Fascism for a long time. The liberal establishment is not against anti semitism, it only works in its own interests to destroy a group's identity. Christian liberals are not going to respond to the Muslim threat as much, but Jews may because of their experience in the Middle East (which is why Israelis like the Lebanese and Egyptian Christians. They both understand what is going on). 
Most of them want to work with Christians. When Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III protected Jews and allowed them to work with Christians, they wrote religious hymns praising him. My grandfater's friend is nearly 90. He talks about the Austrian emperors like he was alive then, and he loves them.

While at the same time, we take some ideas from socialism, though not western socialism (especially not the liberal style socialism), but DPRK style Socialism (Philippines and DPRK are small countries, and the DPRK did well before 1995) or at least our own Socialism, even if deaths arise from mistakes done (the USSR rose in a few years with their industrial revolution with equal casualties compared to the west, A.

Now concerning NS, when i first joined i was a fervent nationalist and despised Nazism, in the terms that ""we fought the gerries in the War, how can we idolize them?""! That changed when i dwellt into NS ideology and philosophical works, and it made it clear for me that NS was the most pure and sincere form of Nationalism, the nationalism of the blood, tradition and land!

Assuming they're 100% correct on what Hitler believed in (again i say, <em>assuming</em><em>)</em>, then it makes sense why he promoted a ""racist"" ideology to unite Germany and help them become a folk. He wasn't trying to make racism his end goal, but merely trying to get as close to his real ideas as he could, without sounding like a tard to the public. He couldn't just come out and say ""Well, there's this mythical race known as the Aryans who diffused into all populations across the earth, and they worshipped the sun and hated the Jewish demiurge, so you guys are going to be selectively bred based on your Aryan features and i'm going to try and get you to stop worshipping your Jew-God and get you to worship the real Aryan God who Jesus Christ really came in the name of. Also, i'll ban eating meat.""",Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,1174,en,961
351,Iron_March,"People would've never accepted that flat out, so basically what he did was say ""we're a racial movement"" because in a way, it was. He never really ""lied"", he just made it more appealing to the public until he was in a position where he could teach people the truth without being slandered by the Jews, and also have the resources to prove his points. Otherwise he'd have been seen no differently than people who make those blurry Youtube videos claiming that the world is ruled by reptilians. And this is what Aryanism seems to not understand: Nobody will follow your movement if you just flat out tell it like it is. You have to sugar-coat things a bit, sell it to them, not say ""This is our ideology and if you don't like it, f*ck off."" You have to make them want it, and by saying all of your intentions openly, people probably just won't want it. Then, again following Hitler's example, once you're in power, you can slowly show them the truth because you'll have the resources to do so. Politics is a game, and Hitler understood that. Of course your intentions and means of obtaining your goals should always remain based on morality and noble ideas, and you should send out a message that draws in the kind of people you want to work with, but other than that, you have to sell it to the public to get them to go along with it, otherwise you're politically obsolete.

A True falangist would have declared war on Mexican narco-terrorist and their government sympathizers.

        Regarding our vision for Kurdistan, I guess we can start with the most obvious: what will <em>not</em> be in that vision. Certainly, I'd say: there will be no parliament, no democracy, no voting, no parties of any kind, no politics at all in the modern sense, no capitalism, no communism, no feminism, no tribalism, no atheism, no Islam, no Abrahamic religions, no Jews or niggers or faggots, no humanism, no globalism, and no trade with the outside world.

        Allegiances or source of income represents the commitment to truth or justice. Just as police protect their monopoly on violence, a hired gun would protect his right to exercise violence for money but be amenable to shifting alliances and circumstances. A fascist would reject both stances as neither owes their allegiance to righting wrongs. Even if police may believe they are while serving a false belief system predicated on using a monopoly on violence for maintaining it, or when the hired gun believes he's serving the only thing that matters. The fascist has the courage to respect and reclaim truth through action, to live it. Direct action is not as valued because it does not require ""the people"" to support what is being revealed or proposed, politics isn't valued unless its used as means to an end &amp; democracy is not valued because its designed to keep out the real right.

        A small minority of Right wing groups have managed to get small percentages into different parliments. Our respective parties<br />
        might win one or two seats here and there. Right wing groups might get a small percentage of votes. Often less than 3%.

        About Slavros: his understanding of fascism is great, but he doesn't have the spiritual essence to go beyond that understanding. I'll explain it in better detail in the message, but simply put, Slavros is making two big mistakes here. First, he's trying to limit divinity (by limiting our conception of the ideal fascist world with practical concerns, as if practical concerns even matter when we're here thinking about the nature of God and Heaven). And second, he's making excuses for degeneracy (by saying that anything less than the Ideal is allowed to exist, he is inadvertently supporting further and further decline). The real conclusion is this: not only is God the absolute form of fascism, but also in reality only God (only the top of the pyramid) actually exists, and anything lower than God doesn't even exist, because it's just accidental fakery and it's bound in time.
",Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,893,en,739

        In short: only God truly exists, and everything else is accidental --&gt; therefore, the final avatar will indeed be God fully manifest, including with magical powers and all --&gt; therefore, this is the final and purest conclusion to fascism --&gt; therefore, we must serve this One Ideal regardless of our time-bound circumstances or practical concerns.

        The thing is, there's ultimately only two groups of people: the perfect Aryans, versus the modernist slaves. There's nothing in-between.

        Also, think about it… just, what exactly is Slavros trying to achieve by saying this anyway? How exactly would this view be applied in an actual fascist movement? Would this be a part of the movement's inner doctrine? Would they tacitly acknowledge the idea of a fascist world government but not care about it deep down? Should we just give up and not aim for a fascist world government anyway, just because we're stuck in Time right now? Essentially, here's the problem with Slavros' argument: for some reason, he is trying to discourage the ideal of fascist world conquest. It's this psychological discouragement that is at the core of what he's saying. But the fact of the matter is, actions speak louder than words, and only the most fanatical words lead people into actual action. So if we're not fanatical about the fascist world government (which itself is undeniable esoteric truth), and if we just try to hide it under the carpet for the sake of compromise, then the whole ideal is just going to erode and die out over time, and our movement will ultimately not be in line with Truth in the eye of God. So if we're not fanatical about the ideal of the highest Truth annihilating everything except for itself, which is the core of what the final Apocalypse is all about, then how are we even fascists?

I currently live in the US (and I think you live in the Netherlands?), so my plan is to go back and forth between Kurdistan and the US for now—between studying in the US and at the same time gradually building up a fascist Kurdish community back home. You and I really need to join forces and work together, since Kurds like us (who know and understand fascism already) are really rare. Simply discussing the massive issues facing our nation and race would go a long way in formulating a clear and final Weltanschauung (which Kurds currently lack), and then working together to gradually build up the movement and implement the necessary societal changes would be a dream come true.

I started as the garden variety conservative libertarian, but I always had niggling doubts about how a people would survive with no identity and no guiding force, even going as far as to say, ""Fascism would be the ideal government if only it allowed people personal liberty."" I also fooled myself into thinking all races were equal and socioeconomic background ruled behavior.



        Fast forward to me working my first job as an EMT in an inner city. It really opened my eyes to the diseased culture of blacks and progressives more generally. Once my notion of equality was thrown out the window, everything else followed. I found /pol/ and started reading the recommended books in the NatSoc General threads. It took a long time before I actually admitted to myself I was NatSoc, but I've been admitting it makes sense for several years.

Right now the group is acting as a sort of fraternity for White youths who are racialist to meet each other. We hope to be able to create a real political presence on the streets through rallies and similar activities, but for now we are still working on the process of gathering enough members to safely do so.

That's called state capitalism with a centralised planning system not socialism. 

&gt;Socialism refers to state ownership of the means of production

No, the workers own it, not the state. What usually happens is that the state assumes control over the means of production via authoritarianism.

CCP is about as Communist as the Democrat People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) is Democratic.

Social democratic societies such as the Nordic Model operate under a capitalist framework. They just have generous welfare nets. 

&gt;Perhaps you can't actually call China socialist, perhaps they're something new and unique.

Not even Chinese people consider their government socialist. Words have meanings. 

Even under a ""state owned system"", the wealth needs to be redistributed and funneled into public welfare systems. The state should also not profit off of the enterprises and industries they own.

&gt; The authors of the study also developed the first ever inventory of glaciers on the UNESCO World Heritage list, documenting about 19,000 glaciers present in 46 out of the 247 natural World Heritage sites.

It's never happened.

The Revolutionary War in the US is much different than the situation is Venezuela. It was the colonies collectively working together with a common government and army against another country. This is more like a civil war. The Civil War in the US is an example you are seeking, except it was unsuccessful for the people resisting the government. Not saying the current dictator in Venezuela is the good guy or anything, just saying having guns isn't necessarily going to get you anywhere. This is a complex situation and I'm not saying people shouldn't be able to rise up and fight for what they believe, I'm simply saying that having a gun doesn't give you the power you necessarily think it does. Unorganized civilians with guns is not an Army, has no infrastructure, and is not a match for a military or police forces. The best thing people can do is continue to protest, I don't think a few shootouts in the streets are going to change much.

&gt; Guaid&amp;oacute; appeared alongside formerly jailed opposition leader Leopoldo L&amp;oacute;pez, who said he had been freed by military officers loyal to the opposition.

&gt; Venezuela&amp;#039;s Socialist Party leader called on government supporters to amass at the presidential palace to defend President Nicol&amp;aacute;s Maduro against what he called a &amp;quot;Small uprising of traitorous [military] soldiers backed by the U.S.&amp;quot; Venezuela&amp;#039;s defense minister said the Maduro government remains in control and that military units reported normality at barracks and bases across Venezuela.

632,Reddit,"Al Jazeera is a slightly left leaning, progressive news outlet with a decent reputation. 

It's financially backed by the Qatari government and it probably gets into some editorial issues with the government financiers at some points but overall it's a pretty reputable org with its own [transparency unit](http://transparency.aljazeera.net/en/aboutus/).

It's director Mostefa Souag is a well educated individual with a lot of ties to western media and worked for the BBC and MBC. 

Al Jazeera itself was modeled after western media outlets. 

Here is Sheikh Hamad Bin Thamer the chairman of the finance board answering some questions around 2001. 

&gt;TBS: How would you relate the establishment of Al-Jazeera to the His Highness Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani's vision of a civil society and a liberal constitutional emirate?

&gt;Sheikh Hamad: Al-Jazeera is going the same direction as the state of Qatar in its recent developments, starting with the elections for a chamber of commerce in Qatar, and also municipal elections with women's participation, as candidates and voters. After a year and a half we'll have parliamentary elections in which women will participate. I think this direction corresponds with the direction of the media, be it Al-Jazeera, or lifting censorship on local Qatari newspapers. The two go together in this stage, and I think the direction of Al-Jazeera is a natural one that corresponds with the strategy Qatar is taking at this phase.

She initiates the divorce after he quit his job (without talking to her), threw an expensive birthday party for their son (after they had agreed to only have a small party because his grades were bad), and brought livestock into their house. This was the final straw in a marriage that he clearly has no respect for.

Because she has a stable, well paying job, and can afford to pay for the house they live in, she stays in their house with the kids while he moves out. The court decides that shared custody will be based on his ability to get a steady job and a place to live. That's completely reasonable. In those three months, he has unsupervised visitation.  

He gets a job as a janitor and an apartment. But rather than focus on building a life for his kids and himself, he sabotages his wife's attempt to find someone to help around the house, and then deceives his wife and children in order to exert control over their lives. Including, but not limited to, vandalizing the car of a man that wants to date her, assaulting him, and putting cayenne pepper in his food (knowing he's allergic to it.)  

When everything finally comes out, why wouldn't she be freaked out? Living a double life, lying to his family and the court? You say there's no sign of mental issues, but the whole thing could be construed as mental illness.  

And in the end, after the judge sets supervised visitation, she goes to the court to request his visitation be unsupervised, and that he takes care of the kids after school.

868,Reddit,"Any critique here gets downvoted and then the old “don’t watch it then” bitchy remark. So expect that.
   Also, I try to suspend a lot of disbelief as far as military and martial and commentators sense tactics go. This show touts girl power to the enth degree especially lately and that’s where Lyanna Mormont and such comes from. Don’t have much of an issue with that. Just think that Aryas been pumped up entirely too much. She was a half trained assassin who spent way more time getting her ass kicked than kicking ass. As I said, Jaime or Theon killing the NK would’ve made much more sense than Arya doing it. It just didn’t fit for me. 
    The crypt scene was a huge waste. The fact that dead Starks came out of their resting place to kill should’ve been presented differently, not to mention, what’s the statute of limitations on the NK resurrections? Those were 100+ year old dead bodies. 
    I did like how Melisandre died however. Her purpose was carried out, she took her amulet off and her very old body gave up, that could’ve been slightly more epic but whatever. I understand that our lead cast can’t die unceremoniously, but soldiers die with no pomp or circumstance all the time. 
   There were things done right, and things done wrong. The music and cinematography were completely on point, it was the storyline that I disliked, especially the whole Walking Dead in the library experience Arya had....very cheap.

However, I don't think that should nullify the rules we've been playing with since the beginning. Fighting off dozens of wights because you're a badass swordsman? Sure! Surviving as an overweight coward who fell multiple times, has next-to-zero battle training, and whimpered while being overwhelmed? Doesn't make sense. Being completely surrounded and backed into a wall without the space to even swing your sword, and then magically being ok the next scene? Doesn't make sense. If you want these legendary characters, actually show them beating the odds rather than just baiting their deaths, cutting away, and then showing them safe.

Also, we don't even see the NK until season 4 and that's through Bran, so there's no way that there have been ""constantly shots of the Night King or his army moving south which were not from the perspective of any of the ensemble cast since they were miles away from any of them.""

Wider? Yes. Taller, not really. If you go back and look at pics, it's not as big as one would've imagined. The only tall part is the actual main castle's wall.

&gt;wight must be killed or else it will keep attacking at full strength

This part actually confuses me. We can see very clearly in Jorah's final stand that a single slash to any part of the body kills them instantly. Need to go back and confirm, but I'm under the impression that a single slash or stab kills them, as does how White Walkers die (seen with both Valyrian steel and dragonglass).

&gt;focused the enemy's attack to a relatively small surface area  
&gt;  
&gt;area of Winterfell that must be defended by an onslaught is much larger

True, I'd agree with that. I guess we can even the playing fields by discussing from the point AFTER the walls have been breached (e.g. Elven archers prepared for shooting upon breach).

So it would make no sense whatsoever for them to take a sizable (over a third) portion of their forces, suicide charge most of them just so they can pretend they all die just so they can later use them in a far less meaningful and dangerous battle that will not happen anyway if they lose this one.

Theon's redemption has been one of the most impressive character arcs I have had the pleasure to enjoy and Alfie Allen did a phenomenal job bringing his character to life (and death). He died honorably as both a Greyjoy and a Stark.",Non-fascist ,No,,Game_of_Thrones,557,en,455
949,Reddit,"1. What are Tyrion and the rest of the south supposed to do? Daenerys has two dragons (three at the time of the Tarly's execution) and two full armies that she's controlling. And I flat out disagree with the notion that Tyrion as a character HAD to do something even if he disagreed with the killing of the Tarly's. Followers questioning the decisions of their leader without acting is something that happens in real life. The consequences of Daenerys' actions are that people don't view her the same as they used to; Tyrion and Varys have lost some faith in her. We still haven't seen the end of her story either, so let's see how it plays out. 

2. The Waif was sent to kill Arya, and Arya fended her off, killing her in the process. Is she supposed to be penalized for surviving and fighting for her life? We saw the consequences of Arya's actions of killing Meryn Trant, they just didn't play out with Arya losing her life, it was the Waif. The Many-Faced God was repaid with a face. Furthermore, we've always known that Jaqen H'ghar is somewhat fond of Arya, so it's not out of character that he would allow her to leave. She completed her training.

3. The stories of Dorne, The Reach and The Stormlands were complete. And if you disagree with me, that's fine, but sometimes you have to sacrifice story for other story. There are only so many episodes in a season, and so many seasons of a show. I don't feel like I missed anything in those locations.

4. The people of the North realized that they needed the Wildlings on their side to fight the war, and Jon made this point numerous times after being questioned about it.

5. Tyrion's strategic blunders have been acknowledged by Dany, but again, the story isn't complete. She clearly thinks that he is still the best person for the job despite some errors in judgment, which she approved by the way, so it's not all on him.

6. Cersei is the clear next in line after Tommen's death. She's the blood of the former king and there's nobody else that could fill the role. She's also ruling with an iron fist, so people are scared of her. She has The Mountain by her side and just showed that she is capable and willing to kill a lot of people. Who's going to challenge that? The people of King's Landing so they can get wiped out by the Lannister Army? And you're right, I don't care at all that Kevan Lannister was killed and i'm glad no more time was spent on that. He was a worthless character.

7. The Dothraki charging into battle was meant to draw the Night King out so Dany and Jon could jump him with their dragons. Sometimes you have to make sacrifices to win the war. Did it play out as intended? No. Was it the absolute optimal strategic decision? No. Jon and Dany aren't great war tacticians and they did make strafing runs over the horde of Wights, but Dany decided to pursue the NK and Jon went after her.

The problem is that we can only go so far with it before we begin to negatively affect what we hope to positively affect.

I'm all for the 2nd Amendment. It was a necessary thing to have when you're literally writing a document that is designed to commit treason against a King.

If you go down to the local gun shop and hear the conversations and what they say about the government it’s nonsensical. Trump and his ilk are a symptom of unchecked nationalism and ignorance that’s been allowed to grow unfettered since 64 and is now creeping its way into mainstream politics. That gun shop talk is now political talk. I’m afraid that when republicans in Congress don’t go far enough that it will cause a split like it did in 2009. And that will lead to violence.

That’s specifically how war works. 

Japan was deep into China before any assistance from the US, as much as your temper tantrum response would like that to be untrue. 

The embargo was placed in 1941, well after Japans invasion of China. 

You should dislike your former government. The bushido culture directly resulted in the subjugation, murder, and rape of millions. Just like I’m ashamed of America’s history of slavery and genocide against the first peoples. Everything that I’ve seen is that Japan, as a whole, chooses to ignore the behavior of the 30s and 40s. 

I will say, the attempt to rationalize the invasion as relieving the Chinese people from the choke of Chiang Kai-shek is an incredible stretch by any imagination. I’m sure the 25 million civilians murdered by the Japanese were very appreciative. 

And to continue on and say that the invasion of Manchuria was going to happen sooner or later is laughable. And to point out all the atrocities by KMT as a way to rationalize all of Japans atrocities is moral relativism, and doesn’t alleviate the terrible things that were done. On math alone though, Japan’s atrocities &gt; KMTs atrocities. 

I don’t think a single American holds any guilt for the outcome of the war. I certainly don’t. 

But let’s be honest dude. Without American protection following a war that you instigated, fought, and lost, the rest of the Asian countries would’ve torn you apart. The Chinese, Koreans, Phillipinos, and the rest will never forgive the Japanese for their behavior. Ever.

&gt; The four-page letter that Mr. Barr sent to Congress two days later gave little detail about the special counsel&amp;#039;s findings and created the impression that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s team found no wrongdoing, allowing Mr. Trump to declare he had been exonerated.

&gt; When Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report was released on April 18, it painted a far more damning picture of the president and showed that Mr. Mueller believed that significant evidence existed that Mr. Trump obstructed justice.

&gt; The senior department officials also found Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s rationale for stopping short of deciding whether Mr. Trump committed a crime to be confusing and contradictory, and they concluded that Mr. Mueller&amp;#039;s report showed that there was no case against Mr. Trump.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-congress-interview-797214/

&gt; One thing that is notable about the speaker [Pelosi] is that she does believe that the Democratic Party should be a progressive party. She is in the difficult position of having to juggle all of these different wings within the party, but her personal politics are very progressive. I have not found an issue where we are really opposed...

&gt; I don’t want to compromise where we’re going, but I’m willing to compromise on how we get there. I believe in single-payer health care, so that every American is covered with physical, mental and dental health care that is free of cost. That’s my vision. If I lobby the caucus enough so that our most conservative members fight for a public option, that’s a huge win...

I'd encourage you to consider the hypothesis that it not's ""centrist"" dems that suck so much, it's really the people they represent. (Due largely to the authoritarian propaganda machine).

A good piece of evidence that this is real, and not made up by neo-liberals to stop progressive legislation, is to study US populations and their representatives. 

There's no ""AOC of Alabama"", even though I guarantee there are people living in Alabama who could be their AOC.

The best progressives in congress right now all represent high left populations. And when you start talking about statewide and national representative strategy, it's really important to accept the reality of those populations, keeping the house requires not getting the constituents of those people pissed off, and just trying to not give a supermajority to the GOP in the senate requires the same.

Care to back that up?

&gt;Not sure why you think it's expensive to make something invented in 1921 and sold for $14 a dose (adjusted for inflation) should be more after expensive almost 100 years of manufacturing advances.

First of all, $14 in 1921 is $200 in 2019 dollars. Secondly, they aren't extracting it from pig pancreases anymore, it's a much more complex process.

&gt;Why did the costs double in four years from 2012-2016? Did a 100 year old drug get more expensive to make all of a sudden?

The first recombinant insulin was made in the late 80s, it's nowhere near a 100 year old process. Not only that, but safety and quality standards have increased exponentially since then, so it is in fact *far* more expensive to manufacture these days. 

And yes, once you get a factory up and running the marginal costs aren't too bad, but getting a factory FDA approved is insanely expensive and difficult. As I said, almost no insulins are currently on patent. There's nothing stopping other companies from making it. If you really think it's cheap and easy to do, why have no other companies entered the market?

As far as the ""costs doubling in 4 years"", that's the sticker price. Yes it's incredibly stupid. You can thank our fucked up insurance system, where large insurers get large rebates (stifling competition in both insurance and pharma). The amount the insulin companies actually receive has remained static or [even decreased over that time frame](https://www.biopharmadive.com/news/sanofi-handed-payers-nearly-12b-in-drug-rebates-last-year/548865/).

1472,Reddit,"Well the most you could lose is the cost of the $294 call if it expires worthless. In that case you would still keep the premium you sold the $295 for. Let’s call that the losing-best case

Your call could be in the money but the one you sold could be out of the money at expiration. You make whatever your call is sold for(I assume youre on Robinhood and can’t afford 100 shares of SPY) and the premium for the one you sold. Best case 

Your call and the sold call could both be in the money. I have no idea. I assume robinhood still closes your position an hour before close. You would make the difference in cost I guess. Worst-best case just cause I don’t know what robinhood does in this situation.

1526,Reddit,"That’s curious. I found this guy talking about deep ITM calls strategy https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qnnrLiIlMGs

It seems that the underlying idea is that the time premium + strike is higher than what you paid for a stock, meaning that you can make money by selling a deep itm covered call. 

So in the video they make the example where the stock trades at $19.67 but the $10 call is worth $10.20.

So basically if the stock tanks, you keep the premium, if the stock goes up, you let the calls expire and when you get assigned, you basically keep the difference. So in that example the P/L is: $20.20 - $19.67 = $0.53. So from selling 1 option contract you’d make about $53.

I haven’t looked at the actual option chain to validate the time premium for deep itm calls, but I will do that in the morning.

Basically I don’t see how you can lose money in this trade. You ride it straight into expiry, you never close the sold calls. Now my broker would auto exercise, but with some reasonable brokerage you could probably get away with it for the most of the time.",Non-fascist ,No,,WallStreetBets,1063,en,874

I’m sorry but being drunk isn’t an excuse. I’m sure there are people that come out stronger after giving their partner a second chance but most of the time a second chance shouldn’t be given.  That’s what I’ve learned from experience.

If you do give her that second chance be prepared to always feel like you can’t trust her. The relationship will not be the same and you might end up feeling extremely resentful.

This has everything to do with shame and [fear of vulnerability.](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_on_vulnerability/transcript?language=en)

People set unrealistic expectations because they are ashamed of themselves. This is a way of setting up a situation so that our most cogent fears come to life. That is, shifting the goalposts for ourselves and others until we feel our fears will be validated. This, instead of focusing on what we need from a person *Right Now.* Shame says that what we need right now isn't valid.

People with feelings of shame often deal with it by trying to make *uncertain* things into what they believe as certainties. Such as, a person's interest and love in the future.",Non-fascist ,No,,RelationshipAdvice,895,en,752

If you're dating non-exclusively and can still fuck others, it's not *necessary* to bring it up right away. If you *only* date exclusively, I'd bring it up immediately. I think it'd be best to bring it up as early as possible since it might be a deal breaker for some people, but I have to imagine that people who consider porn cheating don't date non-exclusively for long, if at all. 

It's hard for me to say though, since as I mentioned I'm not the one that feels that way, and I'm a heavy communicator. It's basically my love-language. So if I didn't feel comfortable talking about it with someone, I'd probably already be incompatible with them. Plus I'm married, so it's quite a non-issue these days.

Maybe he's not fulfilled by the idea of taking care of the house/future kids and not doing something that earns money. 

Also, while being a homemaker is, in and of itself, work, it is not paying work. And if something happens to your relationship, it leaves the homemaker partner in the proverbial dust. 

I did the stay at home wife thing for a little while after the company I was with went under and before I got a part time gig and went to grad school. It was stressful as hell on me because all the time, in the back of my mind, I had ""what ifs"" cropping up. What if my husband got laid off? What if he got sick? What if he got injured? What if he left? No matter how improbable some things might have been, they still popped up in my head. 

It's possible he's coming from a place like that. 

It's also possible he feels he needs more structure (and maybe external structure) than just being a ""homemaker"" can provide. 

Ask him about it. Ask him why he feels he needs to do more. 

&gt;I want him to focus on things he loves without trying to monetize it. I want him to make art for himself, because he loves doing it!

Tell him that. But also tell him you'll support him if he wants to monetize certain things. An Etsy shop only takes as much time as you want to put into it. You're working on no one's schedule but your own if you're not creating custom designs. 

Having a kind of routine that has an external factor (selling to the public) may be good for him.

Honestly, you don't. They're a couple, they come as a pair.

You may need to have a talk with him about that this isn't a sustainable friendship for you. You tell him he needs to be more respectful of your friendship, or you need to not be in it. If it's causing you too much distress, you may need to 'break up' with him basically. You can ask him to try to handle the issue more directly, but that's about it. It's up to him to manage his relationship. If he loses friends over it, that's his choice to make.

Any attempt to keep him but not her is going to exacerbate her concerns and make it worse. You can try reaching out to her and having a heart to heart about how much it sucks and that you'd like to work on resolving it and asking if she knows what might help. But if you do that, you need to be prepared for the possibility that nothing will be resolved.

From Thor 1 and Captain America 1 - the city where Odin fought the frost giants and where Red Skull found the tesseract is Tønsberg, the same city where New Asgard is placed in this movie. 

From Captain America 1 - ""I could do this all day"", and then Cap and Bucky's lines when they say goodbye to each other at the start of this film are the same as when they say goodbye at the end of Endgame except switched - Cap says what Bucky said before and Bucky says what Cap said before.

The reason there aren't as many female characters, is because the people that watch these movies used to be mainly men, but it's starting to change, which is why you're starting to see more female characters on screen. There also aren't nearly as many iconic female Marvel characters to adapt to the big screen as there are male characters, which makes it more difficult to have as many females on screen. Not to mention that having more female characters, just for the sake of having as many of them as male characters is the wrong way to go about it. If the character is great, and there's a big demand for it, make a movie about him or her. Don't make a movie about a character, just because she's a woman.
The point is that the scene was forced and genuinely took people out of the movie, men and women alike.

After which he gets Tony and Bruce to build a new device to get him back to the Main Timeline using the GPS he used to get there a week before he left. Then watching himself time travel out goes and sits on the bench with the shield he used from the other universe.

In fact this is the only way this could have happened. There was only a limited number of shields made, all of which were accounted for before the final battle. The one the old Cap gave had to have come some place else because he didn't take one with him into the past.

First, Steve's shield broke apart in chunks, as opposed to the vision, where his shield is shown to be broken more or less in half.

But that's a minor detail, more importantly there are several parts of the vision that would've been impossible by that point of the movie. Natasha couldn't have been dead on the ground, because she was already dead on a distant planet in an alternate timeline. The Chitari wouldn't be flying away into a wormhole to reach Earth, because the battle took place on Earth, so they'd be flying towards Tony, not away.

And of course, if Tony hadn't stolen the Infinity Stones, everyone would've been dusted, (*everyone* including the Chitari) so that situation couldn't have happened, because nothing would happen, because there'd be nothing left to happen.

2127,Reddit,"**""I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one guy and I ran away""**, explains the protagonist of The Lord of the Rings

&amp;#x200B;

The popular and much loved character of the Lord of the Rings, Aragorn, played by Viggo Mortensen, would surely have faced them sword in hand. But the actor, the real person, has been more cautious. The fact is that the Argentine actor, who has never hidden his passion for football and more specifically for the San Lorenzo de Almagro, to the point that he took a pin from his club during the last Oscars Awards, has explained how he escaped a dangerous brawl with ultras from Real Madrid.

The radical fans attacked him thinking he was a Barcelona fan. It happened in 2006 when Viggo Mortensen, who was immersed in the shooting of Captain Alatriste's film, was mistaken for a Barça supporter.

The actor decided to tell the anecdote 13 years later. It was the day in which his team lost 1-7 against Boca, a match he saw in Madrid with director Agustín Díaz Yanes. The director invited him to dinner at his house, preparing for the occasion. ""I took flags, shirts, hats, scarves ... Then they make us a goal, two goals, three goals ... I sank in the armchair"", reveals in radio 'Vorterix'.

However, the worst came after the game. ""I was in the Puerta del Sol, the ultras saw the colors of my clothing and thought i was a Barça supporter. Those bald guys started to say ugly things and hitting me. I had two bottles of wine, I broke one in the head of one and I ran away. ""

When arriving at the house of Agustín Díaz Yanes, the director asked him if it was blood what he wore on his shirt. Not to worry his friend, he said no, that it was wine.",Non-fascist ,No,,Soccer,1695,en,1384

Before you bring up the CL era (since 92-93) argument, the notion of Big-5 is very recent. Despite that, it's obvious that there are more French teams which have had consistent periods of success than Dutch teams.

Liverpool FC has a very low tolerance for this type of behaviour from their fans, is one of the safest most inclusive places anywhere to watch a football match and will certainly act in suitable manner on this issue. 

Liverpool fans have a good travelling reputation but just like every club, there will always be some bad element.

=

&gt;&gt;The fact that Kovac generally rotates doesn't bother the kickers. But apparently they criticize an unfair distribution of the different times. There was a feeling that players would have to return to the bench or even to the stands, especially after good performances, such as James after his appearance on Schalke or Niklas Süle after his success against Leverkusen.

Literally from the second link.

&gt;Parking the bus was a very good strategy for the first leg and Kovac got a lot of praise for this game. The 0:0 was seen as advantageous for Bayern, as it was a 0:0 in Liverpool, which is not easy to achieve. Liverpool has one of the best offensives of all European teams right now, so it is sensible to play defensively when your players are just not as fast as the ones Liverpool has.

The only reason we didn't lose in Anfield was because Mane was having an off day, period. Even with Niko's grand masterplan, we got exposed at times and we would've conceded goals had Mane not have a day off. Instead of using the absence of VVD to score goals, we used it to defend more. In the second leg we had two shots on target, two damn shots. Should've been sacked for that match alone.

Just replace what you said with that. 

""The normalization of violence makes it easier for someone to take the step. It doesn't actually matter how they commit the violence. What matters is the culture which has formed around violence.""

we are in a culture of violence on every tv and phone regardless of guns. Just this weekend a show where people killed other people that had become 'subhuman' was on tv (game of thrones) and in theaters a movie where humans beat the fuck out of space people broke records. (my favorite show and my favorite movie of the year)

I dont mind these. but they are violent shows/movies that have no regard for the violence they contain because its so normalized.

2371,Reddit,"I’m not OP but I appreciate the civility.

ANY common sense gun control measures would be welcome. Extensive AF background checks, strictly enforced registration, ban on private sales, ban on full auto weapons, or at least special licensing for those, ban on bump stocks, more red flag laws, I would also like to see geographical areas where guns are simply illegal based on population density. So urban areas - no guns allowed at all. Rural areas, go nuts. Those just make sense. 

But to be very fank (and everyone seems too afraid to even suggest it these days) the only ACTUAL solution to all this is amnesty. Slowly but surely remove all guns from the population. Maybe state by state. I know you’ll probably balk at the very idea but this is just a no brainer to the rest of the developed world  - these are problems the UK, Australia etc simply do not have. And believe me, I grew up there, NOBODY is begging to be more like the US on this. It is literally a weekly occurrence to read about a school or a church being shot up. And usually not by isis, but by a homegrown American armed to the teeth.

I swear I mean no offense. It is just frustrating watching this endless debate from a European perspective. But god forbid anyone even suggest Americans give up their guns because “we need to be able to protect ourselves and our families” from a tyrannical government (that in the data and money-driven world of today would never need to have shootouts with citizens in the street to oppress us, get real) ...or a statistically almost non-existent home invasion (while automatically putting said family at exponentially more risk just by having a gun in the home, again, statistically speaking)

Again I’m sorry I know this comes off as snarky and aggressive but it’s fucking heartbreaking seeing so many innocent people die in such mundane places for outdated ideological reasons that people still fervently protect.
