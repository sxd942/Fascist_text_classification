1,2,Iron_March,this journal about twofive pages provides a good amount of information on the corporatist idea in the first pages i am reading it because of my interest in china but i havent gotten far enough to tell you what it says about its china i know that fascists have some interest in corporatism so i thought they might find it interesting,Fascist,Yes,Totalitarianism / Authoritarianism,Iron_March,337,en,275
2,3,Iron_March,as for the book you sent a link to it is interesting but doesnt have anything to do with corporatism just in the sense of corporate bodies being involved in government for the time being you may post it in the fascist economics subforum,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,241,en,198
3,4,Iron_March,i dont know if youve seen many of my posts on this forum yet but i do believe in the inferiority of the negroid race and the overall superiority of the caucasoid race and in particular the ethnic british people out of all white ethnic groups,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,246,en,201
4,5,Iron_March,in defining superiority i rank it like thisphysical health amp longevityone mongoloidtwo caucasoidthree negroidgeneral intelligenceone mongoloidtwo caucasoidthree negroidverbal abilityone caucasoidtwo mongoloidthree negroidenergyone caucasoidtwo negroidthree mongoloidcreativityone caucasoidtwo mongoloidthree negroidagreeablecourteous dispositionone mongoloidtwo caucasoidthree negroidhistorical achievementone caucasoidtwo mongoloidthree negroidphysical beautyone caucasoidtwo mongoloidthree negroidas for economics im more of a state capitalist than corporatist it seems we have similar views already,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,636,en,580
5,6,Iron_March,i actually agree with you about intelligence being separate from creativity i cant recall it entirely but there is a certain gene that is believed to be linked to creativity that is very low in mongoloids and near enough absent in negroids but it is common to find it in caucasoids particularly northern europeans nordics i see iq as a good life predictor and measurement of g but i have a interest in pisa sats and timss as they correlate at a great level with g as well and can be accurately converted into iq scores as richard lynn and many others have shown consistently its been known since oneninezerothree or earlier that the sats correlates highly with intelligence emotionalintelligence quotient is a good measurement too iq is one of the best weve got however,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,778,en,644
6,7,Iron_March,id probably have to reread over the global bell curve to see if lynn comments about the verbal ability of mongoloids raised in the west it sounds plausible though i choose tgbc since that does it for various different countries and has a huge collection of different studies it really is a fantastic book it brings back memories of when i first started reading stuff by arthur jensen i can upload it if youre interested but it will be in jpg formscanned,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,464,en,383
7,8,Iron_March,by energy i mean sporting activity i didnt put blacks at the top because its a common misconception they arent nearly as strong as caucasoids good at football soccer as caucasoids are nor are they better boxers although i do have some admiration for tyson and muhammed ali especially alis race separation views and i do concede that they were good by no means representative of the whole sport or their races ability in that sport ive found a lot of blacks dominate sport in the us mainly for social reasons,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,525,en,435

15,16,Iron_March,the group was started when i collaberated with a philanthropist who indicated he wanted to seriously start a fascist political party in the united kingdom at the time i was in college twozerozeronine and the outfit was essentially like previous internet start up parties and didnt get anywhere i began to question why there was little progress so since then i have been on a developing mission to find out how to make a contemporary movement succeed i started attack as an experiment and it provoked interest among young people many of them were local to me so i organised meetings with them and got to know them all we eventually got shot of our former leader and started everything from scratch just a few months ago the purpose of the party is now primarily for activism of a new kind you can find the bones of this in our activism section though it hasnt been reviewed or spellchecked,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,892,en,733

17,18,Iron_March,dont know too much about them but im generally positive towards the movement im a sucker for good old guard no pun intended conservatism foreign style ofc not our bastardisation of the termit just seems a society is more in harmony with a single established culture for awhile i played with the idea that blacks can be assimilated but they have such a backwards culture im still on the fence though,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,434,en,364
18,19,Iron_March,while i can see where youre coming from i have to disagree the black community suffers mainly from a ghetto effect namely the effect of innate economic disadvantages coupled with stillexisting discrimination working against upward mobility we also need to disperse the ghetto population to destroy the subculture and encourage greater assimilation whilst keeping the southern and american traditions and heritage alive it all comes down to environment,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,461,en,394

23,24,Iron_March,yep at the moment theres a huge argument over what it really is i believe in perons original peronism which was mostly based on mussolinis policies and is thirdpositionist unlike mussolini though he didnt really believed in using violence as much as mussolini and had different opinions on labour unions he believed they should be nationalised rather than abolished he virtually had the same ideas as mussolini on everything highly nationalist somewhat isolationist corporatism etcmost people claiming to be the successors of peron really arent and are just stating that to gain popular support peron is still loved in argentina,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,654,en,555
24,25,Iron_March,just a note of sympathies after reading your debate the term here being more properly lalalaicanthereyoucommie fest with facistcapitalist i couldnt help myself also the southern dialect is probably an affectation during my time as a southern nationalist inserting dialect was often a way just to irritate people while dialect does come through in speech it rarely transfers to paper of course im not an educated selfmade businessman so what do i know,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,465,en,393
25,26,Iron_March,i agree that things need to change dramatically but i am not sure whether a total systematic breakdown is necessary i look at america in a similar manner as rome i think we could very easily be molded into this kind of grand imperial nation while maintaining characteristics of the old guard rome started out as a republican government and then slowly turned into the empire we all know certain institutions remained some left some were absorbed into others but most people often hearken back to rome when they think of the archetypal fascist government,Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,563,en,469
26,27,Iron_March,well it all depends i am not as revolutionary as a lot of the people on here american blackshirt and i were talking and he said he thought the whole system had to be destroyed i wouldnt go that far i kind of view america as analogous to rome and right now i feel like we are ripe for the transition from a republic to an empire much in the same way rome was i think that as americans we really need to be looking at our problems from a more national as opposed to international perspective i know that diving into things like evola using runes and paramilitary uniforms is all the rage with members but that will never fly in america at least not with the majority of people the two most successful fascistauthoritarian leaders in america were huey long and father charles coughlin both of whom appealed to americans on a much more basic effective level when it comes to actual action i am at a loss i think trying to raise a third party from the ground up will not have any success unless there is an extremely popular candidate who defects to the party for instance the bull moose party had roosevelt we at present do not have that i think that a combination of a politcal action committee to try to elect strong centralist candidates coupled with a public think tank to spur discussion and get the wheels of the people rolling would be excellent ideas easier said than done obviously but all plans have to start somewhere ,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,1456,en,1192
27,28,Iron_March,ive been toying with the idea of starting up a fascist movement in australiaperhaps something to combat the campus commies in my universitywhat are youre thoughts on the ideaim thinking of making a new thread about it,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,227,en,191
28,29,Iron_March,the problem is that overtly fascist groups even the lighter forms of it do not do well the communists are tolerated mostly in part to their perceived pacificity if there was a war between the soviets and europe this would not be the case an additional issue is that many of the socially conservative policies extolled by several members of this forum for example similarly do not do well and attract hostility what i would suggest is joining one of the existing liberal small l liberal like the liberal party groups and canvassing to what extent if any there is fascist or at least conservative militarist leanings you may also find sympathisers from the other end of the spectrum as is the nature of third positionist thinking although there you run the risk of running into antifa or worse leftist freespirit hippies starting a thread about it would be good but again the problem i see is that fascism is inherently going to draw hostility and any suggestion of deviation from sixzero yr old outdated manifestos on this forum seems to draw cries of a liberal conspiracy actual political pragmatism or even intelligence seems almost nonexistent although perhaps the departure of wtp will help this,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1223,en,1019
29,30,Iron_March,i tell ya sometimes im truly shocked by how marxist some of the arguments some posters on here make never in my life did i think there would be people who call themselves fascists suggesting the marxists are right about capitalism or that fascism itself is socialist i dont know i just hope people like you and me can make a difference on here and tackle the lies where ever they spring up,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,396,en,324
30,31,Iron_March,i view myself as a variation of oneninetwozeros italian fascism i view it as a template to be modified to work within the context of twozeroonezeros usa will it be the same no it shouldnt i dont even have a completely thought out political process i just know where i am originating for at this point i am not opposed to interventionism in the economy especially in key industries i was only opposed to the bailout of several key wall street firms in that i think that they played us like a fiddle to destroy american families and homes and added nothing to the economy besides easy credit saving american automotive firms i am not against russia has a policy in which they control fiveone of key industrial firms they call these national champions i think most american companies are doing fine and should be left to their own devices to make america great but if need be in specific and pragmatic cases i am not opposed to taking fiveone control of key american industrial companies to make sure our national interests are being adhered to,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1056,en,856
31,32,Iron_March, my value system should reflect the military and it should be pushed onto the populace but im loathe to use a whip and chain to enforce it people need to be shown the inherent rationality and goodness of fascist values but if not let the gangrene take hold of them isolate it from good society and let it collapse on its own merits ,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,345,en,277
32,33,Iron_March,for some people here the internet is the only place where they have a political life and i hate to say it but for most of them fascism will just be a fad and everything will be forgotten when they reach fourzero maybe not people such as slavros or benbut most of them tthey dont have reallife fascist comrades never went to a demonstration never spent the night outside glueing propaganda stuff on the wallso yeah some of them think this is some kind of call of duty or wow game heyyy lets play tough guys and dress up like nazi stormtrooperspersonally i take this with a grain of salt i once was a very young oneeight yearsold interested in politics but being completely out of touch with reality so im not gonna cast the first stone to people behaving like i once did and it is still enjoyable to exchange views with people from over the world and for me to keep in touch with younger generations mindset im fourtwo their ways are not my ways and i do think i also have things to learn from them even if sometimes they sound overly idealistic i still have my reallife comrades for true activismnot online chat,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1136,en,927
33,34,Iron_March,well it all depends i am not as revolutionary as a lot of the people on here american blackshirt and i were talking and he said he thought the whole system had to be destroyed i wouldnt go that far i kind of view america as analogous to rome and right now i feel like we are ripe for the transition from a republic to an empire much in the same way rome was i think that as americans we really need to be looking at our problems from a more national as opposed to international perspective i know that diving into things like evola using runes and paramilitary uniforms is all the rage with members but that will never fly in america at least not with the majority of people the two most successful fascistauthoritarian leaders in america were huey long and father charles coughlin both of whom appealed to americans on a much more basic effective level,Fascist,Yes,Totalitarianism / Authoritarianism,Iron_March,874,en,716
34,35,Iron_March,my favorite strasser quotes are from both gregor and otto from the right we shall take nationalism which has so disastrously allied itself with capitalism and from the left we shall take socialism which has made such an unhappy union with internationalism thus we shall form the national socialism which will be the motive force of a new germany and a new europe gregor we are socialists we are enemies of todays capitalistic economic system for the exploitation of the economically weak with its unfair salaries with its unjust evaluation of a human being according to wealth and property instead of responsibility and performance and we are determined to destroy this system under all conditions gregor p,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,731,en,613
35,36,Iron_March,thank you william youre a true gentlemen and thus a fascist in the highest order as far as im concerned im going to keep fighting the reds wherevevr they rear their ugly heads because its a damn shame they are corrupting our fascism with this marxist propaganda,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,267,en,221
36,37,Iron_March,i am taking a onest year psych class now and the prof said a bunch of crap about poverty explaining racial differences in intelligence and he mentioned shockley only to dismiss him he also praised leon kamin and showed us slides which stated that nazi germany had as part of their eugenics program the extermination of catholics it was all so absurd but i didnt say anything except to point out that the nazis didnt think much of iq tests since ashkenazi jews scored higher than gentile germans,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,497,en,410
37,38,Iron_March,hello and thanks again for posting in my introduction thread as a fellow ethnonationalist i figured i would pick your brain a bit what form does finnish ethnonationalism take i have read that there is resentment towards swedes since finns hoping to attend university must learn swedish and the swedes ruled finland for hundreds of years is this truehow much of a stigma if any is attached to antirussian sentiments in finland due to finlands vulnerability to russia also and ill end it here so as to not overwhelm you what kind of solidarity do finnish ethnonationalists feel for other finnouralic peoples,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,630,en,524
38,39,Iron_March,hungarian nationalists ive noticed hold finland in high regard and ive spoken with many who praise finland hungary sent extraordinery number of volunteers to finland during the winter war to help their brother nation under soviet attack though finns due to distance arent as close with hungarians as they are with estonians our shared blood is acknowledges and especially ethnonationalists have great respect for hungarian people and culture,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,452,en,385
39,40,Iron_March,i dont mind to answer your question im from the netherlands and involved within the autonomous movement there i combine nationalrevolutionary and nationalsyndicalist thought with a healthy and moral etnonationalism because i think a homogenous socialcultural indentity is the most natural way to realize a solidary and harmonic society ,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,348,en,297
40,41,Iron_March,the first american fascist irc conference long name i know starts in roughly twenty minutes you and all other americans are cordially invited to attend further info can be found in the usa subforum instructions for using irc can be found in the information center within the adminship center,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,298,en,250
41,42,Iron_March,i sure can strassers most in depth vision of what a national socialist system would look like was in germany tomorrow here he propounds the need for the redistribution of property and the deproletarianization of all germans strasser goes into detail and says that the class of property owners are transformed into managers accountable to both the state and the workers themselves the manager owns the majority of the stock in the company so he makes more by managing and performing the work that capitalist actually do however the workers too own a share of their company and engage in profit sharing so that the system of wages is anulled strasser also claims this system will give working germans a say in management of said enterprise public trading of stocks is forbidden and market competition is over ridden by degrees of economic planning from the state such as investments and being a last resort employer for members of the folk who work in no enterprise thus ensuring full employment strassers main objection to capitalism was that the class of industrialists capitalists were able to exercise so much influence while leaving the little guys out of it it was unfolkish to him likewise this was also his reason for rejecting marxism a socialism alien to the germany he saw the marxist theory of dictatorship of the proletariat as replacing one class dictatorship with another which it essentially is he envisioned a future of germans working cooperatively and working together as one single entity rather than worrying just about class interest if you have any questions in particular you can feel free to ask me i will also send you the links to the two most important works by strasser in which his ideology is laid out,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,1770,en,1476
42,43,Iron_March,exactly he is a fucking retard and anything is not capitalist is automatically communist and mussolini was a capitalist sweetheart who did his best to deffend the free market but teh evil syndicalists held him back,Fascist,Yes,Glorification of Violence / Leader,Iron_March,216,en,181
43,44,Iron_March,im slacking on my work a little bit but this forum is on my mind now and i feel like i need to deal with it at the moment i just saw this hitler and the final solution thread here check out this post made by some jew named ahad haam on this forum last one on the thread so far,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,285,en,224
44,45,Iron_March,he bitches about persecution and gives off the typical never again cry with the holocaust i do not believe the holocaust happened the numbers of jews killed in reality is very small and probably even justified think of that article about organ trafficking i sent you jews deserve persecution they have been doing nothing but robbing murdering and deceiving for centuries this can and has been historically proven by scholars and researchers i could recommend articles if you like,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,493,en,415
45,46,Iron_March,this kike ahad haam even has the audacity to use the following quote for his signaturewhen gd made the germans he gave them three qualities honesty intelligence and nazism but in his wisdom he decreed that they could only posses two at any time thus if a german is honest and a nazi he cannot be intelligent if he is intelligent and a nazi he cannot be honest and if he is honest and intelligent he cannot be a nazi albert einsteinreplace the word german with jew and the word nazi with murderertricksterthief and then the quote makes sense,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,574,en,475
46,47,Iron_March,you know the jews even claim that the legionaries made pogroms against them which never actually happened in truth it is the jews who have been persecuting my people along with the germans for centuries,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,205,en,171
47,48,Iron_March,forgive me but i will have nothing to do with a forum that allows israelworshipping and jew trolls to run around degrading european heritage and history i dont mean to be obsessive about all this but i have dealt with jewish hydras before and i dont want to deal with them again,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,285,en,234
48,49,Iron_March,i share your concerns about this forum i see the jews as having an interest counter to those of european nationalists albeit i just dont support extermination as a solution as many of the more extreme hitlerites do,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,217,en,180
49,50,Iron_March,i don’t support the policy of extermination simply because i don’t believe it is possible to execute successfully just imagine if we tried it there would be jews hiding everywhere and many people would probably help them hideflee from us it would literally end up like what happened in those fake holocaust tales,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,317,en,265
50,51,Iron_March,this forum does not share our opinions on race being important to the nation and is way too authoritarian for me could you imagine if some of these red white and blue waving fascists came to power here they think that everyone that wants to break up america should be hung the one guy even said in his essay that people who say niggers arent american need to be locked up we racialists would end up like the anne frank story hiding in an attic,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,451,en,367
51,52,Iron_March,that’s a pretty ridiculous attitude to take if you ask me this country is bound to break up if any of the races which came here are to survive the fact is that at this point we cannot deport all of the noneuropean types out of here so i think we need to give them different parts of the country for themselves it’s the only solution really even if we could deport everyone we wanted to we would lose a lot of the population and it might cripple the economy if done too quickly i once theorized that it could be done successfully if we did it slowly and gradually enough but i think that it is best to break up the us at this point into different racial homelands,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,674,en,545
52,53,Iron_March,it’s interesting blood over borders nationalism i think that was exactly what i was trying to teach you back on socialist phalanx when you rejected race for a minute there,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,176,en,147
53,54,Iron_March,what do you like about julius evola there are only a few things i like about evola but i kind of hate his overall philosophy in essence he argues that we should all live in stratified patriarchal caste societies which he justifies using some occult bullshit ideas he also denounces a lot of spiritual beliefs i have as being “lunar” most of what he calls lunar spirituality is good stuff although that’s not to say that what he calls solar is badto elaborate evola’s teachings obviously have some positive aspects from a conservative racialistnationalist perspective especially in his criticisms of the enemies you’re already aware that his teachings on race had some influence on my thinking although i might say that he is simultaneously somewhat misleading when it comes to race as well however i find his doctrine as a whole unacceptable especially his idea of tradition what he calls “tradition” is actually a mixture of practices and beliefs which are not always actually part of what i consider to be proper traditional aryan practices even though a few of them are evola takes things too far the ancient european way of life did include a hierarchical society ruled by a monarch but this elite was folkish ie to love the people as a whole and socialistic even though it practiced a simplistic tribal form of socialism it was not some rigid caste system with an aristocracy obsessing over strange spiritual ideas which no one really believed an example of what i’m thinking of is evola’s idea that we need to be “initiated” to become immortal and the whole “solar”“lunar” distinction which is something i believe he is really wrong about,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,1680,en,1400
54,55,Iron_March,note that oliver is a bit crazy so dont take all of his antisemitic remarks seriously as he sometimes manipulates facts when it comes to the jews but i think he is right when it comes to the khazar theory,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,209,en,170
55,56,Iron_March,official nsdap policy was that people’s religion didn’t matter as long as that religion was not harmful to the race and did not get in the way of national socialism this is stated in mein kampf and i think hitler meant it i agree with your assessment of hitler’s religion i don’t think hitler was a germanic pagan i believe he had his own unique personal beliefs when it came to god and i don’t think he cared about what others believedstormfront is shit but i actually liked enat i have the opposite impression of the people here than you do i don’t think the people here are at all intellectual and i feel that i could intellectually crush them any day i think their problem is stubbornness i will however spend a little bit of more time here and make a few more posts to see if i can get them thinking a little bit,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,828,en,673
56,57,Iron_March,it is easy to get disillusioned when considering the cosmopolitan makeup of our nations today tribalism which is what i adhere to or being a crazy reactionary and simply believing in a nation because it happens to be there are really the only answers to globalism i am not even sure i like the word nationalist as it implies separating europeans on stupid grounds such as different anthems flags and lines in the ground when we are really all part of one big family and should unite i would like to see a united states of europe one day as strasser advocated for ,Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,572,en,469
57,58,Iron_March,i agree that we should have paneuropeanism but i think all of the different ethnic groups and subraces of europe ought to be preserved at least in europe though i don’t think that can be accomplished in north america or australia since those are not of any particular european nationality,Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,294,en,245
58,59,Iron_March,i too actually share your criticisms i think he is too obsessed with eastern occultism and caste systems though i like his criticisms of modern society and i consider myself a traditionalist to a degree throughout my readings of strasser and evola i have found some common connections between their ideologies and found some inspiration in that both want to return to a more traditional european society and strasser based his socialism on a traditional european guild system where hierarchy is completely necessary and left in tact he unlike evola propounds the need to root out injustices of such a system and actually gives us idea how we could develop such a system out of the ruins of degenerate capitalism ,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,722,en,602

61,62,Iron_March,i’m only slightly acquainted with you and your work i did read your articles in attack the other night and found myself agreeing with most of what you’d written i’m worried that too many on the farright are softening their position to the point where they’re no more than liberals concerned over immigration so it was refreshing to read something uncompromising and explicitly rightisti know next to nothing about the british integralist party by the way other than the fact that you’re not an electoral partyinsurrectionist,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,535,en,450
62,63,Iron_March,you are spot on in the three main views when it comes to scarcity i agree the ns view of overpopulation from the threerd world is the most realistic not being racially inclined it tends to not bother me quite as much as others my main problem with the third world is that most of the people there will amount to little more than peasants and are a general waste of resources the cost to keep supporting their countries could be used for much greater things,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,458,en,373

64,65,Iron_March,that this elite is a broad range of average people is a functional reason that its much more effective to have a very large pool of decent governors well integrated and well connected to every single community in the country than it is to have a very high quality but very thin volume elite of governors ruling in a centralized autocratic fashion giving people some rights that are considered democratic isnt to create a truly democratic system because that isnt the goal here the goal is meritocracy and syndicalism the function of holding votes or polls and having something of a constitution principle of citizenship etc all serves to this end and to the end of effectively facilitating the integration of all mass energies and indeed of the entire population into the state a certain level of autonomy and democracy are necessary for this process because only then will you have a fluid flexible selfcorrecting system,Fascist,Yes,Totalitarianism / Authoritarianism,Iron_March,944,en,789

67,68,Iron_March,there is alot of cynicism you get from books like femanine fascism and cultural visions of the far right in england that imply women were somehow used you kind of have to understand womens politics at the time women were primarily involved in politics to be profamily that was their ambition that was what the major womans organisations were there for support and social responsibility to the family unit it may suprise you but most leftist intellectuals who campaigned for abortion and workplace equality were against women having the vote or being involved in politics at all because of their social conservatism this was the reason alcahol was banned in the us because it was destroying homes sylvia pankhurst types were lunatic fringe communists most became involved in fascism insteadwith that in mind it is intuitive that mosley didnt think they were stupid or generally less able but the priority of the economy and the society was around the family unit this is what mosley meant when he said that women were not going to be chased out of the workplace but were not going to be chased in there either i dont think he was opposed to women going to university and getting jobs on principleas someone who served in the trenches he was probably against women taking active service not because they were not up to it but because no real man could have it on his conscience,Fascist,Yes,Anti-feminism,Iron_March,1409,en,1164
68,69,Iron_March,i did believe that was the case feminism has always been a fringe group but the arguments catch on a lot more freuqntly today while ironically women still take up their natural roles theres no glass ceiling its simply because women dont want those higher positions work less hours or are not qualified for them,Fascist,Yes,Anti-feminism,Iron_March,319,en,265

118,119,Iron_March,anyway i have some more to say about ethnicnationalism which might be a good term to replace white nationalism by the way i use to be a white nationalist when i was much younger i am sure a lot of people here started out as wns but have since moved on to more practical ideas the current white nationalist movement here in the united states is very hostile to socialnationalism and conservative revolution to them means nothing more than guys in revolutionary war outfits getting rid of a supposed red conspiracy in the white house ive actually only met a couple guys from keystone united ku that were open to my social ideas but they cant seem to get past the whole onefoureighteight race war mumbo jumbo it is a tricky moment in time we do not want to sew discord among those classes which actually have a chance at revolting against this system but at the same time we want to have some identity beyond just class as well this is why marxists have it wrong and always will humans are more than their social class and job they have ethnic national and religious identities as well which marxist theory discards as unimportant and just a product of the economy back to the point though a race war is the last thing we need not only are whites outnumbered in the world but they are especially in this continent not to mention any whites fighting both a race war and a war against their race traitor government would be wiped out completely we simply do not have the manpower and resources i also think a race war is entirely unnecessary and obviously runs counter to the idea that all ethnicgroups should have a right to self determination like whites,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,1685,en,1385
119,120,Iron_March,in my opinion we need to be harnessing the revolutionary potential of the oppressed proletariat in our nations whether they be white black yellow etc rather than simply agitating hatred against other races i believe that if we have a vanguard party of sorts we can take revolutionary movements back from the marxists and internationalists and ensure that the coming revolution and fall of the capitalist system results in a degree of ethnicself determination and the reaffirmation of identity based on something other than class and the economy marxists to this extent are really not even revolutionary as they are the unwanted offspring of the materialist capitalist thought a true revolution happens not only on the economic plain but happens on a spiritual one as well an ideal one and society is transformed by not just matter materialist thought and not just ideals idealism but a combination of those which forms the spirit of the revolution ,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,967,en,811
120,121,Iron_March,when i speak of dutch national socialism i mostly refer to so called mussertism the ideas of anton mussert the leader of the dutch nsb the nsb is an interesting topic to study when it was founded the only thing that was national socialist about it was the party structure and the name it barely mentioned race or jews and dutch eastindians and dutch jews were proud members of it in fact over seas in dutch east india the nsb was the third largest party economically they were corporatistanton mussert and his branch of national socialism favoured dutch independence and dutch culture while parties like the nsnap nationaal socialistische nederlandse arbeiders partij national socialist dutch workers party used slogans like nederduits weder duitsnethergermany must be german again they wanted to annex us in the third reich such ideas as you can imagine werent really popularby the midlate oneninethreezeros rost van tonningen joined the nsb and he quickly got more and more influence within the nsb rost van tonningen was in contrast to mussert a more progerman national socialist he was more radical if it came to subjects like race and jews these ideas however were not so popular so the popularity of the nsb slowly decreased i mostly use him as the prime example of germanicgerman national socialismthen everything changed because the germans invaded us and made the nsb the only legal party membership reached an all time peak in oneninefourthree mussert had to make loads of concessions to the germans in order to stay in favour the party started to do simply what the germans wanted every time mussert protested something the germans threatened to replace him with rost meanwhile musserts own ideas didnt remain unchanged either he started to believe adolf hitler was send by god to create a greater germanic empire mussert envisioned this empire to consist of independent states working closely together he presented the idea to hitler who simply ignored it he had at the moment better things to do and simply didnt caremeanwhile mussert tried to convince the germans that the dutch ss recruits we had our own ss should swear an oath to the netherlands and mussert and he in turn would pledge allegiance to adolf hitler mussert took the oath but the dutch ss ended up still pledging loyalty to hitler this is the prime reason he was convicted for treason after the war and he was executed,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,2445,en,2039

122,123,Iron_March,yes i realized the need to stop identifying as a strasserite due to the fact that i am an american and not only are such ideas virtually unknown to ninezero of europeanamericans but i dont think national socialism the way strasser explained it would work exactly the way it was supposed to here even though a great deal of my inspiration still comes from otto strasser so i naturally redefined myself as a nationalanarchosyndicalist i would imagine this would combine the best aspects of strasserite national socialism as well as else christensens nationalanarchosyndicalism if you are not familiar with else christensen she was one of the most important people in the revival of the folkish religion odinism which i practice she was also heavily involved in the syndicalist labor movement and advocated a very decentralized form of national syndicalism in which syndicates unions cooperatives etc etc all just different names for the same things manage businesses on a local level id imagine it working like strassers factory fellowship only and i have hinted at this before the numbers would be a little different as for government i believe it would also look like a return to an estates system and natural democracy rather than parliamentarism as advocated by many conservative revolutionaries as well as otto strasser instead of federalized it would be a confederation and much less centralized in order to meet the racial cultural and geographic diversity here in the usa people would be encouraged to organize themselves in their own communities based on ethnic interests or otherwise all communities within the confederacy would be respectful of each others self determination and cooperate i think a constitution would be necessary in this respect it is anarchist in the sense that it isnt centralized and people arent forced to make decisions they would otherwise not want to if one does not wish to abide by the rules of a certain folk community they are free to leave but they must respect the laws of the community while residing there again it would all be democratic but at the same time still maintain the natural organic hierarchy that is essential to the human condition and it would also be totally against any sort of political parties and parleamentarism which seek only to divide and sunder the community into factions,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,2390,en,2003

124,125,Iron_March,yes i disagree with execution and militarism in general there are some people who i find outright disturbing and annoying but as long as they do not represent a direct threat to the folk community than i see no reason to kill them they can go live in communities centered around their own interests we also have to take into account how capitalist consumer culture and liberalism effects the untrained mind now a days ,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,423,en,349
125,126,Iron_March,im ambivalent about militarism on the one hand it has enormous mobilising and unifying power but on the other hand as goebbels said paraphrasing talleyrand sitting on bayonets is uncomfortablefor good reading on distributism i suggest interesting concepts include the principle of subsidiarity a return to a revised guild system and a particularly spiritual for lack of a better word perspective on the statemy confusion about wodenism was that it sounds like a wodenist worships that god specifically while germanic pagans worship the pantheon as a whole so i assumed there would be some differences,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,726,en,628

135,136,Iron_March,one ive always been disgusted by religion mainly the judeoabrahamicchristian religion in particular religion breeds ignorance and prevents one from thinking rationaly the founding fathers of my nation where deists secularists and agnostics they did their best to keep this festering disease of religion out of american government and politics and for a good reason as for atheism rejects the existance of god as a fiction devied by man desperate to keep on living despite the inevitability of death for centuries atheists thought presented in fair light were prevented from making their mark on the world due to the feudal ignorance of organized religious intitutions that existed the age we live in may seem nihilistic but only in the eyes of christians and believers in fact its existentialistthe true believers of yesterday and the day before have every interest in characterizing the worst and most negative aspects of contemporary life as products of atheism for many religion is their way of life shaping their morality and ideas through the belief in god rather then lgoic for many the imposibility of thinking or acting outside their religious sect which has laws regulating every tiniest detial of daily life all these things militate against reason and in the favor of submission its almost as if religion needs to innocence lack of education and ignorance in order to thrive religion truley is an opium of the masses and perhaps in this way you can get the slow but ultimate disappearance of the churches as institutions of power and minds conditioning the individual as a citizen must be devoted and dedicated only to the requirements of the stateand its national community and not to faint and hypothetical ideas of supernatural also for this reason to wear any elements that are outward signs of religious affiliation should be allowed only to clerics not to ordinary citizens but this will only happen with a gradual persuasion not by an act of force otherwise it risks reinforcing the grip of religion on society creating more myths and martyrs yet religions cant be unfortunately easily eradicated at least in the short term what i think is important is that churches and their institutions and their teachings are always subordinate and subject to the authority of the state are deprived of all privileges and destroyed churches which take away money that could be invested for the needs of people their teachings and their morals are against the principles of the state and do not carry out activities for the state in this way perhaps in time you can get that religion goes back to being what he always had to be that is a private matter that concerns the privacy of the individual,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,2779,en,2309

151,152,Iron_March,my ideology could be thought of as civic nationalism although i loathe the term and the connotations with it i look towards rome for much of my inspiration of government i feel america was based more appropriately on the grecoroman ideal of republicanism and not really on the liberalism that it got swept up in if you look at the two systems roman and american you see several similarities and i see america branching out and expanding its huge influence even more i feel we are teetering on the edge of forming a much more imperial style state than our current democratic system much like rome did due to similar events and circumstances ,Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,651,en,537

267,268,Iron_March,for germany i believe in german cultural heritage to me this includes catholics protestants jews and maybe some odinistsgerman pagansi believe that german success is a result of these ideologies so i consider them german and i consider movements that oppose them to be anti german ratheri say oneninetwozeros because this was naziism before anti semitism toward non christian germans having read books of göbbels diary i am aware that he was named after a jewish friend of his family and his favorite professor was jewish he also would chastise occasionally on anti semitismobviously this position changed mostly for political expediency and hitler who did not want to kill jews or legislate against them was urged by göbbels hitler almost never did anything of his own that persecuted jewsbut ultimately it is an adapted form of ns that i believe in something that germans believe in and not americans who are racial revisionists with liberals,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,968,en,814
268,269,Iron_March,yes i am in america currently in north carolina to be exactmost people will think of the racialist ethnically confused americans likely because many on the internet are american and americans no matter whether they are far left or far right are essentially brainwashed by the same institutions of thinkingi do see it being a problem sometimes it is so alien to some people interestingly all of these people have been americans that they think i must be joking or disingenuousi am not sure what i would call myself though but i was inspired by the early works of strasser in some waysit is good you asked though as i was considering posting in the thread about national socialism but i would probably be criticized by the americans who think national socialism is entirely about gassing kikes as if anti semitism was apart of national socialism when it first rose in popularity though it was not before betrayed by göbbelswhat does a prussia socialist or meritocrat mean to you,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,1010,en,842
269,270,Iron_March,i drew a few things from strasser myself i think that they should have listened to himyou should go ahead and post on that thread anyways to kick up some dust and force people to thinki must ask now that gassing has been mentioned what do you think regarding israel and the holocaust,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,293,en,241
270,271,Iron_March,as for your own questionsi stray away from fascism in favor of meritocracy for a simple reason fascism centralizes power upon one person but i cannot trust that person to be any good id only be a fascist in such a sense if i were the leader or someone i know well and trust deeply so a suitable alternative when a leader is lacked could be a meritocracy a meritocracy is somewhat similar to early greek democracy or even to a spartanlike system even though sparta wasnt democratic basically only the elite can vote and anyone whos looking to get any rank or power is forced to prove that they deserve it through merit of course merit can be an abstract thing so its tough to decide how it should be evaluated in modern society democracy could work with limited numbers however thats not democracy at all but meritocracy if such a criteria is applied but in everything else i roughly favor regular good old fascism,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,949,en,784
271,272,Iron_March,but i like what you said and the link of prussian socialism alsoi think we agree in our dislike of liberal jews and their use of the holocausthowever i cannot prevent but to feel some solidarity with israel when the liberals come to the side of germany when preußen königsberg ostbrandenberg etc were lost to russiapoland then i will take the liberals seriously in their complaint of israelis in the west bank,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,429,en,358
272,273,Iron_March,i intend to inquire further onto your platform of national socialism i will not do so in your introduction thread as it is an introduction thread amp nothing elseas a man born in germany amp an adherent of orthodox national socialismi am what your strasser called a hitlerite i carry a great amount of respect amp solidarity for your people we fought together although they were for different visions goals amp reasons we still fought together and solidarity in battle is one of the most important bonds two cultures can shareid like to inquire upon your opinion of orthodox national socialism as opposed to leftstrasserism,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,651,en,546
273,274,Iron_March,i dont have a platform yet per se just starting points mostly in spirit borrowed mainly from the stennesstrasser duo and japanesepanasian nationalism borrowed from ishiwara minus the weird nichiren stuff im sure orthodox ns is fine as it is my main critique of hitler is his compromise to the capitalists and his lack of a coherent system saying different things to different people for his own political ends i understand that was necessary to obtain and keep power but that is my main objection to hitler if that is not the case i would like to know more about it,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,595,en,495
274,275,Iron_March,i think many people are paranoid anti socials on the internet especially ultimately sites as this but i agree many jews think non jews just want to kill them which often they do and the stance of neonazis do not help this perception anyway i am considering i am done with this site there is nothing really to be learned from the internet site when i return to germany i will return to involvement with the national socialists i knew debating with americans about politics is ultimately pointless they will never acknowledge that national socialism has been a progression similar to how religions pick from what they like and what is logical from illogical texts,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,677,en,563
275,276,Iron_March,so i suppose some of my rejection for this is from not understanding how that movement is pro german today the only people who threaten germany today are arabic muslims who have neither nordicgerman features or do they value what christians and jews value culturally i see them and their terrorism against germans and their sharia law as the real problem todayi will say that if you truly are german jew or christian i would lay down my life to defend you as my brother such is my belief in nationalism hopefully in our non internet lives we can defend germany together as allies of the german cause if not thats ok i simply believe that antisemitism fuels the liberals of the west in their anti german resolve and the liberals in the german government who oppress the nationalist spirit of germany,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,820,en,679
276,277,Iron_March,but like you i also am opposed to the idea of jews in germany who believe they are their own nation within a nation however such jews live in israel now and not germanyalthough i do express nationalist solidarity for israel but i know better than to believe they must leave or die i believe in conversion to the cause of nationalismif they do not like the idea then give them a ticket to israel israel needs people to sustain itself against the arabs anyway,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,471,en,387
277,278,Iron_March,my family is of traditional catholic orientation amp many of them have always held steadfast to old traditional german values my antisemitism radicalized throughout my travels meeting many jews who were a stark contrast to the loyal image displayed by some german jews these foreign jews were such a stark contrast in the sense they often looked upon me with contempt fear or both for my affiliation with national socialism and for being german alone essentially prior to that i had the idea that as long as a jew assimilated amp put forth his german identity above all that there was no issue ,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,610,en,506

280,281,Iron_March,im a supporter of national socialism but am realistic in thinking it well never happen here but ive been this way since i was onesix still learning more everyday ive done a lot and seen even more if you ever have questions about what its like with people like this in real life im your guy to ask ive stayed with fascists of casa pound in belgium and ns in germany my interest stemmed from playing call of duty two believe it or not how about you what led you to consider fascism,Fascist,Yes,Nazism,Iron_March,486,en,394
281,282,Iron_March,i like that link and agree with essentially everything he said i shall explore this further the problem many people here have is they are like being fascist but they are not interested in having fascism they talk about how jews are evil and are surprised when they become liberal anti fascists they are not interested in progressing fascism in the real world in my opinion jews have been ready for fascism for a long time the liberal establishment is not against anti semitism it only works in its own interests to destroy a groups identity christian liberals are not going to respond to the muslim threat as much but jews may because of their experience in the middle east which is why israelis like the lebanese and egyptian christians they both understand what is going on most of them want to work with christians when holy roman emperor frederick iii protected jews and allowed them to work with christians they wrote religious hymns praising him my grandfaters friend is nearly ninezero he talks about the austrian emperors like he was alive then and he loves them you cant really tell them that,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1129,en,935
282,283,Iron_March,welcome personally my idea consists of this so forgive me if i am sounding messy or my message looks messy in the filipino context that means we filipinos will preserve national values respect to elders love of country and so on and take good parts of filipino character discard bad ideas like total hospitality love for usa too many while taking the good things from socialism how socialists do it and discard bad things namely internationalism disregard for labor class wars liberal democracy while at the same time we take some ideas from socialism though not western socialism especially not the liberal style socialism but dprk style socialism philippines and dprk are small countries and the dprk did well before onenineninefive or at least our own socialism even if deaths arise from mistakes done the ussr rose in a few years with their industrial revolution with equal casualties compared to the west a slavros said it in some webpage in da if it goes bad then we filipinos could take corporatismsyndicalismremember that j a primo de rivera saidfascism was born to inspire a faith not of the right which at bottom aspires to conserve everything even injustice or of the left which at bottom aspires to destroy everything even goodness,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1282,en,1073
283,284,Iron_March,well a lot of needed qualities are largely forgotten these days this is the great failure of our modern world it just shames me that even in a community of various nationalities ethnic ranges etc united all by our common disagreement amp opposition to the modern world our great divider are the jews youd think itd be something else im certainly not perfect in any regard but i know my faith and i know my culture,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,430,en,355
284,285,Iron_March,my signature just means a lot to me adolf hitler saw a mans mother as his hearts lockandkey and im inclined to agree i could hate all amp turn against everything even my own but i could not turn against my mother like him i know a day is coming when i will escort her through her last days and she will ask nothing more of me that will be a bitter hour for me as it should be for any selfrespecting male ,Fascist,Yes,Glorification of Violence / Leader,Iron_March,424,en,340
285,286,Iron_March,ah i see baader and meinhof were geniuses in many departments then i was just curious what you meantalso what do you think of the european archeological discussion about the indo european andor proto european identity of europeare you familiar with marija gimbutas or die ethnogenese der europäischen indogermanen or the kurgan culture and the indoeuropeanization of europethey study what european culture was like before the indo europeansaryans came from russiablack seathe two theories are europeans were conquered or the two meldedin some norse cultures it is pointed out both culturally european and culturally aryan elements and except estonian or finnish european languages are indo europeanwhat is your opinion on proto vs indo european values as opposed to proto or indo european genetic mix,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,850,en,727
286,287,Iron_March,adolf hitler was certainly no monster the man was extraordinarily emotional and extraordinarily pragmatic he knew the reality of moralism though and knew the reality of certain ethics like egalitarian ethics and accepted these realitiesand also accepted the reality of the human food chain and intended more than anything to place germans atop that food chain regarding the antislavic tendencies of sorts like himmleri honestly find himmler to be a coward the same with goering i hate them both with so much ferocity i am not concerned with hating slavs nor conquering slav land,Fascist,Yes,Glorification of Violence / Leader,Iron_March,604,en,508
287,288,Iron_March,i am concerned with conquering german land colonized by slavs like polish prussia or places like the kaliningrad oblast as far as im concerned most slavs are basically brothers to germanics we are the two strongest peoples in europaalthough i cant say im too fond of the polish regardless of everything theyi just dont really find myself liking them all that well how do you feel about ukrainian russophilia,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,425,en,356
288,289,Iron_March,yes i am ukrainian the gdr was just as bad as any other communist terror regime and from what i have read the eastern parts of germany still bear some scars from that time wrecked economy high unemployment etc communism is a disease and any commie no matter if he is a typical leftwinger or one of these nazbolfuckers should be locked away luckily i was born just after the soviet union collapsed however in ukraine today the power is mostly held by different kinds of mobsters and oligarchs so in the end not too much has changed sadly enoughi definitely agree with you on that one it also proves once more that adolf hitler was far from being the monster he is portrayed as nowadays but quite the contrary a sophisticated man who genuinely cared for his nation as well as for his loved ones sure ns germany had a lot of flaws but hitler was at least in my eyes not responsible for any of them all the flawed aspects of ns policy such as eg the irrational hatred for the slavic peoples can be traced to equally flawed characters eg himmler,Fascist,Yes,Glorification of Violence / Leader,Iron_March,1076,en,882

292,293,Iron_March,i have heard about danskernes parti before read about them on realistense i think i am convinced that a true ethnic nationalism is the only thing that will save us from the genocidal policies of today the cultural nationalism of sd and df will merely lead to a slower death of our peoples than the policies of globalist partieswhat i like about smr is that they so to speak but a boot in the face of politicians they stand up for their beliefs and are not afraid of being radical but what i don´t like is that they are very sectarian and very suspicious of people who dont exactly think in the same way as them,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,623,en,508
293,294,Iron_March,its a great danger to the whole of europe from any aspect we can never predict what is going to come out of that godforsaken frozen pit half the time and whether or not it is going to be friendly with us we germans certainly tried twiceand in the first weltkrieg we had nearly done italthough in the second weltkrieg we could have done better but we tried regardless one day we may try again germans will always feel die drang nach osten the drive to the east in the neverending pursuit for lebensraum we simply need to remove this pseudogerman government for germany right now isnt germany germany has been dead for quite some time,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,669,en,554
294,295,Iron_March,yeah danskernes parti is in good contact with our swedish brothersnaturally ethnic nationalism is the only solution to our corrupt political system that is merely driven by egalitariaism as a judgementaltool the decadent lobbyism and naturally the undermining of our peoples the fake nationalist parties is a heavy factor of what is ruining our parties way into the goverment of course their strong believes is admirable but we are in an era of changewe need to change we need to adobt the our political enviroment and sell the idea of nationalism in such a way that it doesnt scare away the general populas modern nationalism as i like to call it,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,675,en,565

296,297,Iron_March,my views on economics are more like that of the strasser bros then that of the third reich though i feel that compromising with the bourgeois was the right thing to do however ns germany was state socialist as warsocialism was implemented during the war its a shame that gregor was killed i think killing him as well as many people that were slaughtered in the night of the long knives were a mistake hitler even felt terrible after the night of the long knives on the other hand many of the people needed to go and it was playing it safeitalian fascism only became more antisemetic postoneninethreesix racism became a part of italian fascism due to imperialism race is important and a white supremacist imperialist foreign policy should be implemented against africa and the middle east i do dislike antisemitism against italian jews i am only very antisemetic against american and to a lesser degree european ashkenazi jews,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,929,en,771
297,298,Iron_March,one i will answer what attracted me to golden dawn at first because its how things began i was a fervent nationalist you could say basically i had strong patriotic sentiments since my childhood and a personality craving for the extremes this and the fact that when i was in my early teens there was the thing we down here call the myth of golden dawn a mystical aura surrounding the name of the organization indicating a dynamic and totheextremes organization attracted me now concerning ns when i first joined i was a fervent nationalist and despised nazism in the terms that we fought the gerries in the war how can we idolize them that changed when i dwellt into ns ideology and philosophical works and it made it clear for me that ns was the most pure and sincere form of nationalism the nationalism of the blood tradition and landtwo the thing with wns is that their philosophy and main ideas are flawed and as such their tactics come out equally flawed what makes me content with them is their lack of bones to adress issues as they really are and play with words in order not to be labeled the bad words sometimes getting to the point to look like utter clownsthree of course times have changed things are going on faster and farther and the world struggle is played in larger scales now europe faces asian coalitions from the right the yanks from the left and an enraged african population from below a landmass with only sevenzerozerozerozerozerozerozerozero indigenous people has to face five billion people surrounding it thats why the fraternal competitions of the past must remain there and not resurface if we want to protect our sovereignity our culture and our values from the hoards of afroasian invaders and pastatlantic corruptors,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,1760,en,1456
298,299,Iron_March,certainly though to explain the idea in full detail properly it will take a little bit of explaining on other matters first i wish to create a strong state founded on nationalism and civic responsibility with a centralized government overseeing matters of public affairs in this state everyone does their part to provide for the state as a whole and works with the government to do so citizenship in the state is dependent on service you cannot become a citizen unless you accept the contract of citizenship and serve three years in the national guard in the guard one receives training job skills discipline and works to protect our borders and fulfill civic responsibilities upon completion of your service you become a citizen with all of the rights benefits and responsibilities that entails according to your citizenship contract,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,855,en,718

300,301,Iron_March,i do hate kikes you are simply a scourge upon the earthi am of the view that no matter how savage barbarous and unintelligent a person is they can be tamed negroes can be tamed abbos can be tamed indians can be tamed whites can be tamedi see no reason to annihilate any of these races it is simply immoral to kill a person who only needs a proper education to become at the very least notdestructive i cannot imagine the twisted minds of those who advocate genocide against any nonjewish racejews however no matter what you do to them simply oppress and destroy usually financially as if we goyim are their personal playthings every society they have been part of have rejected and destroyed them it is easy to see their lies google pogrom see what happens when yids and goyim mixjews have blood on their hands the blood of the righteouskikes always find a way to cheat and stealkikes are responisble for liberalism communism usury the current economic crisis and feminismkikes never stop whining about anythingkikes are trying to unite the world as one nation under financekikes lie incessently jewish made swastika graffiti reported as hate crimes is very commoncircumcision is fucking weird,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,1265,en,1057

303,304,Iron_March,a couple of weeks ago i was reading up on chicago economists and their works and i came across one in particular which made me jump for joy and confirmed my convictions about slavery in the us yet another attack on the leftistvictimnigger bullshit that niggers in the south were had it hard ive posted articles before in praise of slavery and put it into a more objective light to dispell the leftist selfloathers and guilt trippers but this one in particular sounds fucking amazing its called time on the cross the economics of american negro slavery and its written by robert william fogel and stanley l engerman youve probably heard of it or perhaps even own it,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,688,en,571
304,305,Iron_March,it basically dismisses all the liberal myths and the economic myths of how hard and exploited niggers were in the south i usually find that i later stumble across things that align with what i already thinktheres a lot of bullshit leftists spew about the south and while any selfrespecting nationalist and racist doesnt give a shit what leftists think or any dead niggers its always good to rub salt in the wounds and show liberals up for the liars they are and attract those spectators on the sidelines,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,511,en,423
305,306,Iron_March,interesting questions i think that women should choose their husbands and enter into a subordinate life willingly they should also have the right and freedom to leave that relationship for appropriate reasons ie domestic abuse as far as a woman participating in government i guess it would depend on the capacity i dont know if i would ever vote for a woman but if we are discussing whether a woman should have the right to vote well i think they should whether or not a woman votes after marriage is a discussion that should be had between the man and woman ,Fascist,Yes,Anti-feminism,Iron_March,572,en,469
306,307,Iron_March,i dont often know if what these people say is correct or not they read a lot more than i do they are better informed but i have one tool that does not fail me it is my ability to detect things that are contradictory you cant promote antisemitism while praying to a jew you cant stand against internationalism while promoting it in a different sort of label they praise national socialism while national socialism was antichristian and merely forestalled a confrontation until hypothetically winning the wartheyre just too western even the russian is too western i feel like an alien am i the only one not wholly poisoned by these ideas even yourself a partjew that should be accordingly to their points the one least capable of understanding such things get it more than they do possibly because your complexity forced you to have more than one point of viewwe need neither corrupted west nor decadent east nor black south we need a northern civilization and in the northern civilization there will be no room for apologists of the cross and walking talking contradictions maybe they are part of the problem that we commonly bash here on the iron march,Fascist,Yes,Xenophobia / Nativism,Iron_March,1186,en,986
307,308,Iron_March,they are somewhat well read internationalism is not bad if it means empire building like revolutionary syndicalists that made italian fascism advocating social nationalism and conquering countries like libya ethiopia bringing back the roman empire which would essentially mean multiculturalism,Fascist,Yes,Imperialism,Iron_March,302,en,263
308,309,Iron_March,i think most of them are scared to abandon christianity even though jesus would disagree with them if alive todayassuming they did not call him a kike and despise him their fear i think is mostly from a subconscious belief in hell and a belief that being antichristian or antichrist is something that alienates them from a vast number of europeans who believe in revelationsit would be a bad public relations move for too many fascists to be antichristian because then it would support some rightwing claims that hitler was an antichrist and such alienating whites especially ones that would see such a behavior as a fulfillment of christian prophecy,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,666,en,557
309,310,Iron_March,anyway i agree with you protestantism had a point when it opposed jews and the catholic church it did not want outside control however it was a failure or at least inconsistent with the doctrine of jesus because maintaining christianity and hating catholics and jews is a contradictiona truly free northern people would not be christian or jewish or hindu or muslim or anything else that originated anywhere except along the oder or donau rivers or something that can claim truly spiritual nonpolitical the main failure of rosenberg ns but aryan origins but something that emphasizes morality and ethics in addition to nationalracial solidarity,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,662,en,559
310,311,Iron_March,if truth be told we are both somewhat alienated on this site in terms of our true opinions fascism has always been about strong charismatic leaders as much as any set ideology charismatic people who have messages of economic or social independence can mold the rules to their nation christianity still has an appeal for charismatic leaders because it is a contradiction like many other religions it gives conviction if you talk about god and people like you people like moral men because they seem like savior figures like moses or jesus and christianity is the first unified european basis of morality and code of ethics fascists who disregard morality as a modern construct will fail in populist appeal ,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,724,en,605
311,312,Iron_March,i agree hopefully international jewry will be eradicatedwe must remember that christ pbuh suffer persecution due to his revolt against judaism yet his dedicated followers managed to survive and pogrommed exiled and holocaused themit might take years but it will happen,Fascist,Yes,Anti-Semitism,Iron_March,282,en,242

313,314,Iron_March,oh okay on the immigration and destruction of culture and race i have to disagree but do understand it perfectly the feminists and the minorities i perfectly understand sometimes i believe people are overly sensitive specially before i was into learning about politics i used to believe that some people abused the hate crime laws and that there should be equal hate crime laws against the rich and whites and that too many people use this as an excuse i am and have always been against affirmative action as it is reverse racism and believed more that it usually isnt a hate crime but it was just coincidence that the person you killed is black i might have been to naive and nonracist though and believed that everyone was the same but oh well i want equality for them but i dont want to champion them as that would be reverse racism and sexism just as well ,Fascist,Yes,Anti-feminism,Iron_March,893,en,728

317,318,Iron_March,i agree with your analysis about mosleys leadership credentials a powerful orator but a thinker and a polemicist rather than a party political leaderi believe that hitler was right and he was the best germany had at the time im fairly dismissive of conservative revolutionary attacks on hitler though i think some strasserite criticisms of his collaboration with big business to be legitimatean esoteric hitlerist as fair as i understand it though i havent read any of the primary material is essentially someone who deifies hitler sees him as a god transcendental figure or reincarnation of some prophetic figure from hinduism or christianity ,Fascist,Yes,Glorification of Violence / Leader,Iron_March,663,en,559
318,319,Iron_March,knowing what i know about the correlations of heritability of certain traits the levels vary between men and women too and genetic recombination it would be difficult for the state to select for specific traits ill just come right out and say it eugenics should just largely apply to nonwhites thats what every white eugenicist primarily has in mind any way scumbags in scum bag families can be sterilized from birth and not be given welfare at all you could implement a one child policy as well at the least but i think you could gear society towards chastising certain people and their behaviours anywayi still hold some desirability for eugenics but i get he point youre making medicine has also allowed dysgenics and disease to actually thrive i think theres even a part in mein kampf that talks about it i know quite a lot about the health care profession and how much of a shambles it is and how much of it is a fraud it helps that one of my sisters is doctor it would have been my second choice profession to go into despite my radical opposition to the politics and intellectualism that surrounds the practice today,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,1146,en,946

384,385,Iron_March,cool your chatting with saleam not to sound like a broken record know im preaching to the choir but the problem i see with soft one nation type nationalism as what aus first is sort of replacing but with more backbone is how much of our struggle is spiritual and racial in nature as opposed to wholly materialistic and economical because if we toe the line on soft amp big tent nationalism will it not lead us back to old labor because that is in essence the soul of our nationalismwell the root i dig your respect and see the relevance of van tongerin as a young bloke i just dont get that rebel feel to current nationalism here aus first in which their focus seems to be a lot on our economy understand the reasoning and tactic behind it,Fascist,Yes,Ultranationalism,Iron_March,761,en,621

416,417,Iron_March,i dont mind the idea of a bigger pool of people to find still unconscious fascists in but in that sense the altrights purpose is simply that of a vetting space where we separate the fascists from the useless whereas the altright sees itself as a kind of growing coalition that maybe seeks cohesion so the attitudes are vastly different i dont support the vast range of views notion mein kampf strong man is mightiest when alone the alt right to me is mostly made up of cowards seeking strength in numbers so they are ready for compromise so long as everyone involved are fashy which is actually defined by the enemy and not them since they let the enemy call everyone to its right fascists to a communist a social democrat is a fascist but to a fascist a social democrat is a communist because they might as well be from a hardline perspective of either fascism or communism because they strictly outline what they are and everything that isnt with you is against you so the altright is a collection of everyone who got called fascist by the progressives by virtue of them not being progressives or not as progressive as the modern day progressivists but that doesnt make them fascist by our own standards so we cannot allow them into our ranks nor can we join their coalition if someone wants to accept our ideals and join us thats one thing because we keep our hardline position and strength coalitions are built on compromise compromise is where the truth goes to die hence why fascists cannot earnestly participate in this kind of thing but can only stand by and scope out potential fascists who can join our ranks,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1651,en,1360

457,458,Iron_March,how to achieve fascist ideals this is just me thinking out loud here by the way nothing more nothing less lets have a look at the right wing movement in europe for the past threezero odd years a small minority of right wing groups have managed to get small percentages into different parliments our respective parties might win one or two seats here and there right wing groups might get a small percentage of votes often less than three we all know this achieves nothing no right wing party can achieve a fucking thing without an absolute majority so are we wasting time and our votes supporting these right wing fringe groups suppose just suppose we all vote for the most loony left parties in our respective countries by we i dont just mean fascists but every one who wants their fucking country and culture back once you take away the stigma of nazis at least half of the european population want closed borders less immigration less islam less rape and less crime the biggest ally the right have had in europe in decades is angela merkel and no i am not trying to troll anyone here mad merkel with her suicidal genocidal anti white anti german anti christian policies has done more to recruit moderate conservatives to the right wing spectrum than the npd afd edl dvu etc could have ever done race war will happen in europe by voting right we are just delaying it,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1575,en,1223
458,459,Iron_March, about slavros his understanding of fascism is great but he doesnt have the spiritual essence to go beyond that understanding ill explain it in better detail in the message but simply put slavros is making two big mistakes here first hes trying to limit divinity by limiting our conception of the ideal fascist world with practical concerns as if practical concerns even matter when were here thinking about the nature of god and heaven and second hes making excuses for degeneracy by saying that anything less than the ideal is allowed to exist he is inadvertently supporting further and further decline the real conclusion is this not only is god the absolute form of fascism but also in reality only god only the top of the pyramid actually exists and anything lower than god doesnt even exist because its just accidental fakery and its bound in time,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,893,en,739
459,460,Iron_March, in short only god truly exists and everything else is accidental gt therefore the final avatar will indeed be god fully manifest including with magical powers and all gt therefore this is the final and purest conclusion to fascism gt therefore we must serve this one ideal regardless of our timebound circumstances or practical concerns we dont matter and we dont exist only god matters and only god exists if we even think otherwise if we even believe otherwise then were not fascists,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,525,en,435

461,462,Iron_March, the thing is theres ultimately only two groups of people the perfect aryans versus the modernist slaves theres nothing inbetween all cultures and civilizations are ultimately accidental and fake and most races are too inferior to deserve to exist blacks jews etc and ethnicities are only real if they are built on the grounds of the aryan race otherwise theyre fake and accidental too so once again we return to the conclusion of total fascist world conquest namely by the most perfect aryan elite with the highest spiritual qualities,Fascist,Yes,Supremacism / Racism,Iron_March,565,en,469
462,463,Iron_March, also think about it… just what exactly is slavros trying to achieve by saying this anyway how exactly would this view be applied in an actual fascist movement would this be a part of the movements inner doctrine would they tacitly acknowledge the idea of a fascist world government but not care about it deep down should we just give up and not aim for a fascist world government anyway just because were stuck in time right now essentially heres the problem with slavros argument for some reason he is trying to discourage the ideal of fascist world conquest its this psychological discouragement that is at the core of what hes saying but the fact of the matter is actions speak louder than words and only the most fanatical words lead people into actual action so if were not fanatical about the fascist world government which itself is undeniable esoteric truth and if we just try to hide it under the carpet for the sake of compromise then the whole ideal is just going to erode and die out over time and our movement will ultimately not be in line with truth in the eye of god so if were not fanatical about the ideal of the highest truth annihilating everything except for itself which is the core of what the final apocalypse is all about then how are we even fascists do you see what i mean,Fascist,Yes,Fascist,Iron_March,1343,en,1098

923,924,Reddit,yeah i think bran did a lot more than people are giving him credit i feel like he knew what pieces needed to be in place in order to defeat the nk and he clearly knew that going out to the godswood would draw out the nk and probably that arya would need that dagger in the end what’s more curious is what he was doing while he was “gone” during the battle because i doubt he was just flying around in a crow the whole time,Non-fascist ,No,,Game_of_Thrones,428,en,342

926,927,Reddit, no they are dead the battle with cersei is unimportant at that moment it was literally a battle of life over death there is no possible way dany and jon weren’t going to use up every last resource they had at their disposal to face this threat if they lose then that’s it humanities finished so it would make no sense whatsoever for them to take a sizable over a third portion of their forces suicide charge most of them just so they can pretend they all die just so they can later use them in a far less meaningful and dangerous battle that will not happen anyway if they lose this one no sense whatsoever i’m sorry i love the dothraki to but they’re done,Non-fascist ,No,,Game_of_Thrones,681,en,545

1525,1526,Reddit,that’s curious i found this guy talking about deep itm calls strategy it seems that the underlying idea is that the time premium strike is higher than what you paid for a stock meaning that you can make money by selling a deep itm covered call so in the video they make the example where the stock trades at oneninesixseven but the onezero call is worth onezerotwozeroso basically if the stock tanks you keep the premium if the stock goes up you let the calls expire and when you get assigned you basically keep the difference so in that example the pl is twozerotwozero oneninesixseven zerofivethree so from selling one option contract you’d make about fivethreei haven’t looked at the actual option chain to validate the time premium for deep itm calls but i will do that in the morningbasically i don’t see how you can lose money in this trade you ride it straight into expiry you never close the sold calls now my broker would auto exercise but with some reasonable brokerage you could probably get away with it for the most of the time,Non-fascist ,No,,WallStreetBets,1063,en,874

2370,2371,Reddit,i’m not op but i appreciate the civilityany common sense gun control measures would be welcome extensive af background checks strictly enforced registration ban on private sales ban on full auto weapons or at least special licensing for those ban on bump stocks more red flag laws i would also like to see geographical areas where guns are simply illegal based on population density so urban areas no guns allowed at all rural areas go nuts those just make sense but to be very fank and everyone seems too afraid to even suggest it these days the only actual solution to all this is amnesty slowly but surely remove all guns from the population maybe state by state i know you’ll probably balk at the very idea but this is just a no brainer to the rest of the developed world these are problems the uk australia etc simply do not have and believe me i grew up there nobody is begging to be more like the us on this it is literally a weekly occurrence to read about a school or a church being shot up and usually not by isis but by a homegrown american armed to the teethi swear i mean no offense it is just frustrating watching this endless debate from a european perspective but god forbid anyone even suggest americans give up their guns because “we need to be able to protect ourselves and our families” from a tyrannical government that in the data and moneydriven world of today would never need to have shootouts with citizens in the street to oppress us get real or a statistically almost nonexistent home invasion while automatically putting said family at exponentially more risk just by having a gun in the home again statistically speakingagain i’m sorry i know this comes off as snarky and aggressive but it’s fucking heartbreaking seeing so many innocent people die in such mundane places for outdated ideological reasons that people still fervently protect but that’s my take from the experience i come from i’d respectfully like to hear yours,Non-fascist ,No,,News,2014,en,1665
